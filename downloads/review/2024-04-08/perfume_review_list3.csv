The scent is sweet-gourmand. Projection and longevity are above-average.

Quite badly this was with the Guidance I really did not bear at all.\n\nThe fragrance starts very nice gourmandig and smells like baked apple with cinnamon. I was totally happy that I did not smell anything from the Akigalawood. But after a few minutes, this note then rose to my nose, at first only discreetly, but with time more intense.\n\nDirectly on the skin it remains very gourmandig for a long time, the sillage, however, consists for me really very quickly exclusively of Akigalawood.\n\nI own, by the way, the Angels' Share and can really not understand that many smell there a similarity. The Angels Share smells for me intensely hazelnut, woods and cognac and also the sillage is dominated by these notes.\n\nThe only common denominator for me is the cinnamon and the classification as winter fragrances.\n\nThe Angels Share also smells very linear to me, while the Khamrah has a changing scent progression.\n\nFor me, these are two completely independent fragrances.\n\nThe flacon, however, I find super high-quality! Since you really get something for your money and if you like the fragrance character, then you really get a very qualitative fragrance. Price-performance ratio therefore top."", ""Short and sweet; I'll leave it to others to enjoy their own eloquence.\nThe packaging is very successful and of high quality, as is the bottle. The lid is made of plastic, but that is forgivable.\nSpray head also absolutely fine.\n\nThe fragrance itself is very sweet, but with a spicy note, which definitely sets it apart from other sweet winter fragrances. Over time, it becomes a little duller and more mature. Perfect for restaurant visits during the cold season. Since its DNA is not terribly complicated, there is hardly any question of whether to buy it or not. Anyone who likes sweet fragrances with a spicy, grown-up note is well advised here, especially in terms of price. Blind buy.\n\nLongevity is definitely fair for the price, it is strongly perceptible for 6 hours, after which it fades. i can definitely get 8 hours of overall wear out of it before it gets too close to the body.\n\nIn short: a nobrainer in winter for all fans of sweet perfumes.\nIf you want a somewhat simpler, more affordable fragrance that is very similar except for the spice, Otto Kern Beyond Horizon is a good choice in my opinion."", 'I think the Khamrah is an independent fragrance (with similar fragrance DNA) and not a direct clone.\n\nI am really totally thrilled with the Khamrah.\nFor me, it seems a little less sweet and less cinnamon- and caramel-heavy than Angels Share, but a little woodier and, unlike Angels Share, I perceive a baked apple and date note in the opening.\n\nAlthough the hype has died down a little in the meantime, it was/is totally justified in my opinion, especially when you look at the price/performance ratio The longevity is very good and the sillage is also at least upper-mediocre.\nThe bottle and the general packaging also look very high quality for the price.\nOnce again the oriental fragrance house Lattafa convinces me. :)\n\nI can hardly wait to wear the fragrance for the first time at a Christmas market :)', ""The Khamrah is a wonderful fragrance in my eyes.\nWhen you consider the average price you can get it for, it's really amazing.\n\nA fragrance that is perfect for the cold days of the year.\nWarming, sweet-oriental impressions that invite you to feel good.\n\nCinnamon, vanilla, date, tonka bean, praline and Siamese benzoin in a dreamlike interplay.\nThe top notes in particular evoke associations with delicious desserts/sweets. Desserts that are often eaten in winter.\nPossibly even baked apple vibes.\nThis is really super nice!\nOver time, this slight baked apple impression fades a little for me, but the sweet notes still remain.\nThe cinnamon comes out a little better and the fragrance also takes on more creamy notes.\n\nThe performance is really good and once again you can only say that it's simply great for this price.\nHats off to Lattafa, but Lattafa is known for creating very good fragrances for affordable prices."", 'Why are you wearing a men\'s perfume? I\'m asked that too often. Let\'s just get that nasty question out of the way first, shall we?\nWhile there are certain scent profiles that seem inherintly female or male, that\'s because we as a society deem them such. Floral & sweet = female, whereas spicy-woody or clean-citrussy is male. As someone who wore (another of those horrific labels) “old lady” fragrances at 16 - meaning similar ones to my mom\'s scenterie – I don\'t care for boxes. Yes, I like sweet, I like floral, I even like fruity (which, apparently is “too young” for me, sigh). But I also like woody. And spicy. And ambery. The only reason I\'m not into leathery or yellow citrus perfumes is because my skin chemistry does awful things with it.\n\nSo many times I\'ve seen a ""homme"" fragrance\'s pyramid and thought ""Ehm, make the bottle \'girly\' and it could easily become popular on the women shelves. Sweet scents haven\'t been just for the ladies in a long time, and if you look at Middle Eastern perfumes, where the majority is unisex to begin with, you\'ll see that the guy-fums maybe have a little more (w)oudh or spice, but not always. I personally think when it comes to perfumes they have the right majority-idea: everything is for everybody.\n\nReview>>\nWhich brings me to the Fragrance of the Story: the much lauded, much hyped Lattafa -Khamrah. While it\'s officially an Arabic concoction considered the second coming of Angel\'s Share, a popular men\'s fragrance by Killian, most of us know it\'s only *loosely* inspired by the boozy apple pie juice. The bottle is duped. The scent? Meeeeh.\n\nEven though the Angels didn\'t protest to sharing, Lattafa took its pyramid, extracted what they liked most, then doubled down on their own Middle Eastern twist and voila: a gorgeous brown liquid in beautiful bottle entered YouTube Frag-circles and everyone went a lil\' cray-cray. (THX for that by the way. Not. I tested it júst after release, but had to wait for €€ to buy a full bottle. By the time I could, the hype had doubled the price here.\nEdit: after 2 Souk\'ers didn\'t reply to my ""I\'d like to buy your bottle"" I was about to get a 2nd, bigger, decant when lucky me got a Notino notification: Khamrah was back in stock AND only €44,- ex 3.95 shipping. So, I\'m going to enjoy the Lattafa next winter for the original price! ).\n\nWhich begs the question: is it really worth it? Sadly, quite often a hype is nothing more than every social media channel copying someone else to stay somewhat relevant. So, am I bravely fighting the label-posse for naught?\nTo be honest, I rarely find the prices of perfumes ""worth it"", but I do think a lot of people will like this fragrance - men and women. Fair warning though – again- : if you are attracted to Khamrah because you\'re dreaming of smelling like Angel\'s Share for a fraction of the price... don\'t buy it. There are certainly nice dupes*, with a twist and with a very close to Killian-DNA, but both in its pyramid aswell as its scent on my skin, Khamrah is simply a unisex gourmand that could be loved by Angel Share enthusiasts on its own merit. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe pyramid >>\nIf you\'re into a bit of sweet with a whole lotta kick, Khamrah will light up your day. Especially if that sweet isn\'t floral or fruity, but closer to end of the year yummies (for those countries celebrating Xmas).\n\nKhamrah has a gingerbread meets cinnamon rolls kind of sweetness with a few extra delicious things thrown in. Which isn\'t strange considering the notes of cinnamon and nutmeg in the top.\nIn the opening these two spices are strong and when they start to diminish a bit, the cinnamon never leaving completely, they get company from tuberose and milk chocolate covered dates. Yum!\n\nOn some days however, I had an issue with that tuberose. I\'m unsure if it was my hormone levels, my diet or something else, but there were certainly moments when the tuberose turned skanky, ruining the entire composition, overpowering everything else in the juice. Think of throwing away a bouquet of flowers that has been standing a few days too long. You take them out of the vase, inhale the leftover water, aaand get a very distinct sweet-sour, almost rotting smell. Thàt. Thàt.\nRuined Khamrah for me. It could be the bergamot pullling strongly, mixing with the white flower and turning her indolic. It is why – in case I\'m not alone – I recommend spread testing with a decant. Not a blind buy.\n\nOn the days the note, or better said: my skin, behaved the flower simply added sweetness that translated somehow as a very coconutty heart – straight into the base.\n\nThat base leans heavily on vanilla and the three woods; Mahogany from the heart, and Akigala + Amber woods on the bottom tier. Here and there the benzoin and myrrhe give it extra depth and warmth. I\'ve often heard describe Khamrah as “boozy”, but I\'m not getting any of that. Just like the apple pie has never entered my olfactory senses when wearing this chique Lattafa.\n\nThese are just two of the reasons why, for me, Khamrah is its own fragrance. A gourmand that might attract Angel\'s Share lovers because those are gourmand lovers – not due to the overwhelming similarities. I honestly think Lattafa made a smart marketing move with the packaging. YouTube & TikTok did the rest.\n\nSo, I\'m not getting a Killian, but what I dó get – save the sometimes issue with the tuberose – is a wonderful set of spicy and mature gourmand sweet accords with a coconutty-date heart that\'ll be great on anyone and everybody. As long as you like smelling like a snack.\n\nWhile Khamrah unfolds and follows different steps in the pyramid it\'s in many ways pretty linear. The first whiffs are a good indication of what you\'ll keep. You\'ll just get a tad more sweetness from the very edible heart and a vanilla-warm-woody base to have both a longer lasting effect and depth. That spicy cinnamonroll/gingerbread opening stays with you - though in a more subdued way.\n\nProjection and sillage are moderate. Longevity is ...hours. And hours. Which came as quite the surprise. My skin doesn\'t project and “eats perfume”, making beastmode fragrances and very longlasting scents a near impossibility. Khamrah does it though. Even a first test with one spray on the top of my hand stayed for 8 hours. A full wear remained even longer and kept a moderate projection quite constantly. I\'ve not tested on clothes, as I rarely do so, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if that would result in a 24h+ wear.\n\nKhamrah is whatever you want it to be, but I assume most people\'ll wear this fragrance in the colder months of the year. It is also when it performs best, though I have worn it to bed in Fall and cooler Spring days.\n\nAll-in-all: while the original reason for the hype is weak (dupe), many have definitely, accurately designated Khamrah\'s worth. The fragrance can measure itself with scent and quality against a niche caliber juice and come out, if not on top, then certainly holding an award for “Best Middle Eastern Gourmand of 2022 with excellent marketing”.\nNB* I\'ve tested several dupes/inspired by Angel\'s Share and am considering a short blog describing them all.', 'Today I evaluate once my latest acquisition. I was able to test the ""Khamrah"" now for 2 days and must now simply give my two cents.\n\nIn short: It was love at first ""Sniff""!!! Me envelops a breath of Christmas market - and although the season has not yet started. A scent of warm apple strudel and baked apple embraces me. Based on this, I must note that I would rather not wear this scent on a summer day now. In the autumnal ""dirty weather"", however, he fits perfectly.\nI do not feel currently in a position to wear another fragrance.\nAbout the durability, I can say that he holds about 6-8h on the skin with me. On my clothes I perceive him longer. The sillage is extremely strong at the beginning, but falls off with time.\nGenerally, he holds but a working day well through. Who still wants to the ""after-work party"", can like to re-spray.', '... can be quite helpful! At least that\'s what I discovered when I enriched my personal Parfumo series with a repeat of the ""Angel\'s Share"" episode and the ""Khamrah"" episode, which had been removed from the program...\nI was very fascinated by the bottle and the notes of Angel\'s Share shortly after it was released - and by the fragrance too. So soft, so round, so elegantly alcoholic... Unfortunately, I got tired of the fragrance shortly afterwards. And sold it again. So far, so good.\nOn one of these days, when I was tired of making decisions - decision fatigue, I read, is a symptom of my job, in which I make up to 1,500 decisions a day - and lolling listlessly in front of YouTube, I saw a video in which Angel\'s Share was very much slated. Because I think so little of the source of this channel, this video almost challenged me: ""Bad? Okay. I\'ll watch it again.""\nUnfortunately, I found Angel\'s Share quite expensive. And THAT was the moment when Khamrah appeared on the scene. Enthusiasm! Great bottle! Great pyramid! Great comments! And a wonderful prize!\nKhamra quickly moved in with me and I thought I now had my Angel\'s Share back. But unfortunately that wasn\'t the case. I was so bitterly disappointed. Khamrah is, as many write here, really a fragrance in its own right. But I don\'t think it needs to hide behind Angel\'s Share. I don\'t get on well with it. I do perceive the subtle spicy tones, but there is something so harsh, dull and dark in the background that I find it rather unpleasant to wear after a short time. I don\'t find this harshness masculine at all, that\'s not the problem. It\'s just that I find the fragrance relatively flat, it doesn\'t go into depth, doesn\'t spread out in developments, doesn\'t lead along winding paths to drydowns that surprise, but remains very linear and very intense in my eyes, and that builds up in front of me like a wall that is simply too powerful for me. In my opinion, the fragrance lacks the softness that makes it possible to wear spice fragrances at all. I don\'t eat cooking spices on their own, a teaspoon of cinnamon or even nutmeg would be extremely unpleasant (and probably also very unhealthy). For me, spices need to be integrated into a soft, restrained base, to which they add the finishing touch like diamonds to an elegant, simple dress. They have to make the base sparkle, and they must not appear pure. One idea I like about Khamrah is the smell of warm apples with a slight acidity, such as Boskoop, associations with warm apple pie. But in Khamrah, this note overwhelms me, as if the apples were not embedded in soft, tender, buttery shortcrust pastry, but in fresh concrete. Khamrah is therefore not the right fragrance for me. And so, in the end, my path led me back to Angel\'s Share, which I won\'t give away again and won\'t share with any angels.', '... the time will come when I can finally unpack Khamrah again! If you\'re as perfume-crazy on TikTok as we are here, I think Khamrah is really hard to pass up in the long run. I\'ve had it for a year now, when it was still rare at times, so I ""had"" to buy it blind. Was it worth it? If you\'re looking for a 1:1 dupe of Angels\' Share, you won\'t find it here in my...', 'People who think that this isn’t worth up to $150, either don’t own any single niche fragrance, and hence, prejudiced, or they’re just complete biased haters, that have this illogical and wrong view on Lattafa, prolly because they do clones. And here lies my problem with society—the inability to judge things, open-minded!\nBut I digress.\n\nKhamrah opens up with sweet mix of dates, wine accord, cinnamon and something coconut-y. I do get a kind of woody/leathery vibe in the background. It progresses over time and loses that dates smell and becomes kinda balsamic and woody; with vanilla, Tonka bean(also detected in the opening), woods and myrrh being the star here. I don’t wanna go in depth on the smell, as it’s still new to me and many people have already done justice to that.\n\nThe performance on this, is mind blowing. Put this on my arm, an hour later, I took a nap and woke up 2 hours later and was like “Jeez, what’s this beautiful aroma?”, then I realized I sprayed Khamrah... and lo and behold, it was just as if I was just spraying it. It’s just too strong and loud. I just got it and It’s been 5-6 hours now and it’s still loud.\n\nEven tho I know quite some things, I’m still not a big fragrance expert, but I can tell you that I have smelt heavily synthetic bad fragrances that costs over $25, but this is just as smooth as hell. This is beauty personified, and I’ve used and tested hundreds of Lattafas. If you think that most Alharamain Amber Oud range is okay for over $80 for 70ml(I think), and this is too much for the $65+ for 100ml it’s going for, then you’re biased. This is the exact problem I had with a reviewer that said Roja Apex is like the ‘niche version’ of Sauvage elixir... WTF! Just because it’s Roja doesn’t make it any better!!!!!!!! Fraghead(most especially the niche snobs) should stop these irrationalities!', ""Khamrah is not a fragrance, it is the absolute power you can wield in your hands. Sniffing it for the first time, I was completely blown away. Transport yourself to a world of sensation and depth of fragrance with just one puff. A very unobtrusive bergamot opens perfectly in the head note leading it's way to the good booze - a very balanced sweetness combined with a creamy alcoholic note and cinnamon gives a sense of immense luxury. The great complement to this fragrance is date and praline, doing the atmosphere of an expensive gourmand wrapped up in 24 karat gold. In the end we are led into the bottomless abyss by myrrh and vanilla, making both an indispensable base scent for icy days. The perfume is decidedly unisex, with no emphasis on either side. If you want to dazzle those around you and receive a wave of compliments, this is the fragrance you should choose without hesitation. The longevity is very strong, after using the perfume you can smell for up to several days on your clothes. There is absolutely no need to reapply during the day, unless you want to smell even more intense. The bottle itself is very well made and the packaging is stunning. The Lattafa brand has once again done a great job. Something so well composed for such a small price is something you don't come across everyday. If you can get your hands on it, buy it."", 'After all the ""hype"" I wanted to try this fragrance too. Now I\'ve bought it too. The perfume blew me away after the first spray! A very beautiful and sweet fragrance, which is perfect for the winter and Christmas season. The durability as well as the sillage is very good for this price. The perfume goes in the direction of ""Emporio Armani Stronger with You Intensely""\n\nConclusion: I would definitely recommend the fragrance to anyone who likes winter perfumes and who also likes the oriental/sweet direction. The price is around 40€, you can\'t go far wrong with it!', 'I really like the scent, its amazing for the price and quality. Amazing performance, i smell it for like 3-4 hours in the air quite strong, after that it starts to settle down, but i can still smell it on me for 8 to 10 hours. I also got some compliments by my co-workers. In conclusion i recommend this perfume.', 'I have seen on Tiktok constantly as many Lattafa fragrances were hyped, including Khamrah. The opinions on Parfumo were divided therefore I have bought me first a bottling. To me: I generally do not like very loud and penetrating fragrances that could possibly disturb my fellow human beings. Now to Khamrah: I sprayed the sample on a strip and the first thing I smelled was...', 'Christmas last year - my boyfriend gives me Khamrah by Lattafa, and I can\'t wait to try it out. My first fragrance from Lattafa and immediately so confused. What is that? My first thought: ""Oh God no... that\'s not me!"" I don\'t recognize myself. Unfortunately, I have to give it back to my boyfriend because it suits him. Sometimes it\'s like a striking color. Although you admire it on others, you know it doesn\'t suit you. I think because I was somehow told that, being blonde, I should only wear flowery, fresh fragrances, it threw me off track.\n\nFor me, the initial notes are characterized by cinnamon and a hint of brandy. Then everything thickens a little, the dates enrich the fragrance and it becomes rich and dark. A scent like from a café that sells specially spiced pastries during the Christmas season. You wait excitedly at the counter and take in everything around you. It smells of cinnamon, chocolate and cake. A cinnamon bun with apples is the order of the day. If you want, you can get a hot chocolate with cinnamon. After all the excitement in the café, you sit down, a candle burns next to you and you get used to all the sounds and smells. It gets cozy, and the candle smells of vanilla and faintly of wood. It\'s homely.\n\nI really have to thank Lattafa, because little by little I\'ve been venturing into Beast Mode fragrances like this. It was almost an awakening of oriental, powerful perfumes. I can\'t imagine my collection without this treasure. My boyfriend and I have to share it because now he doesn\'t want to give it up either. I have received sooo many compliments and just feel comfortable and magical when I wear it.', 'I don\'t know the AS but through most digital media and this site you have to stumble across this fragrance at some point, which is often compared to the AS.\nThe components sounded interesting and the many reports made me curious, so I got myself a sample (the low price convinces you very quickly).\nThe first impression after spraying it on is sweet, very sweet. I only detect cinnamon minimally and briefly. A slight sweetness remains the whole time, which is joined by a rather artificial vanilla note with a ""buttery"" aroma. I can\'t describe it any other way.\nThe fragrance is very present at first, but I don\'t have this extremely long-lasting fragrance experience.\nFor the price, you certainly can\'t go far wrong but I would recommend a small sample before buying. Even though the fragrance is stated as unisex, I personally see it more on women.', ""Batch 05/2023. This scent, is otherworldly. This is WAY different then Alexandria BFL which is supposedly one of the best clones of Amgel share. Still I haven't smelled KAS, but this is absolutely insane! You get a soft floral, woody, creamy BOOZY scent. The floral is apparent, and compliments the warm cinnamon booze OUTSTANDINGLY. This is a top frag, imo. I just sprayed 30 mins ago, so no talk on longevity or sillage, but the sillage is there for 30 minutes at least. Huge sillage too. Amazing stuff. For 40$ you will NOT find a better scent!!!!"", 'Well, the fragrance could come from an angel, and it\'s not only here that a similarity to Angels Share is drawn.\nBut what Angels Share does in Boozyness, Khamrah tackles differently with a date-like, almost ""Christmassy"" spicy note - and I like that. Here, you don\'t have the feeling that you\'re smelling too much mulled wine, but rather as if you\'re enveloped in a cozy, sweet olfactory mantle.\n\nThe longevity is also great: it\'s not incredibly penetrating for going out and after a few hours it settles in so close that it\'s still perfect for cuddling.\n\nFor this price, definitely a no-brainer for fall and winter, neither man nor woman can go wrong.', ""I bought this fragrance blindly after reading a few reviews of Lattafa-Khamra. I didn't have a hard time with it because the price of 30 euros for 100ml doesn't involve much risk.\n\nThe perfume arrived and I was totally delighted with the presentation, as you would expect from our Arab friends. The box is very high quality and the bottle, of course a cuboid Angels Share bottle, looks very nice and high quality.\n\nNow let's get to the fragrance, I sprayed the stuff on the back of my hand and for the first 10 seconds I got an alcohol sillage around my hand, I had expected this as this is often the case with cheaper perfumes.\nAbout 10 seconds later I had a wonderful delicious scent. Dates, cookies and honey, everything imaginable in this direction, but also a bit of boozyness, which is much more dominant in Angels Share, was in the air. The fragrance is very strong and has a strong sillage and is very well received by people around you, definitely a compliment magnet. Unfortunately, this fragrance hardly has any noticeable development, but that's not a bad thing, this fragrance is ridiculously strong for this price, Lattafa could have charged a few euros more. A great companion for the winter, super delicious, very often I applied this fragrance to my hand just to be able to smell this delicious scent while working, this is also due to the fact that you have a great tendency to become smell-blind with Khamra, which should not irritate you in any case because this fragrance is clearly perceptible and has a super sillage. Overall a perfect, evening fragrance for fall and winter, a super strong buy."", ""As a fan of Angels' Share, the hype surrounding the Khamrah has of course not escaped me. And for the price, you can't really go wrong. But what the fragrance has to do with Angels' Share is still not clear to me. My passion for gourmand fragrances is just as great as my passion for sweet fragrances. Despite this, I couldn't quite make friends with Khamrah.\n\nKhamrah is definitely an attention magnet, how could it be otherwise with such an obtrusively over-the-top perfume. Fortunately, the penetrating, exaggerated sweetness, which I find unpleasant, recedes in the drydown. What remains is a less exaggerated sweetness and the gourmand character breathes a sigh of relief.\n\nHowever, the fragrance is too flat and somewhat synthetic for me; it lacks dynamism. And if I had to smell this scent on someone all the time, it would be more headache than pleasant."", 'I ordered the fragrance blind.\nA real bargain at 40 euros for 100 ML and great for winter.\n\nThe fragrance reminds me of a Christmas baked apple with cinnamon, covered in melted praline. You have to like sweet scents.\n\nBrutal longevity with strong sillage. Seductive and suitable for the masses. Top for the price.', ""Had tested a sample of the Angel's Share months ago and so came across the Khamrah of Lattafa. Tjo, and here is now my review.\n\nFrom the first spray, I felt transported to a sweet, smoldering oriental dream. Dates, really sugary sweet dates, framed by intense vanilla and a vibrant hint of cinnamon. So you must be into sweet stuff otherwise better stay away from this right away! After the first opulent sweetness settles a bit, the fragrance becomes woodier and more mysterious, with this warm, almost soothing note, but never completely displaces the sweet tones.\n\nThe sillage? A beast! You'll be smelled before you enter the room. And the longevity is impressive, it sticks to you all day and beyond.\n\nOf course there are some parallels to the Angel's Share by Kilian, but then the Khamrah is its own thing. Sweeter, not boozy and overall different. Find both good!\n\nIn a sentence: for the price it is worth a try, but beware of a blind purchase if you are not the biggest fans of intensely sweet, opulent fragrances!"", ""And as the title might suggest, we are heading in the direction of the Kilian Angels Share. ATTENTION: We are talking about the direction & not a 1:1 dupe. Many will probably have become aware of this fragrance as a dupe or imitation of the well-known Kilian perfume. I can tell you straight away, it's not the same fragrance & yet it shines! How do you ask yourselves? I'll..."", 'For me, a perfect symbiosis of baked apple paired with cinnamon and honey.\nThe durability and sillage surprise me every time. It literally sticks to the skin and clothing. Even after 3 days where you had already forgotten that you had sprayed the jacket with it, you are immediately reminded of it again.\nMy go-to fall/winter fragrance! Just reminds you of Christmas and a good time with your loved ones.', ""My impressions:\nBaked apple, sweet, roasted almonds, cotton candy, gourmand.\nLittle fragrance progression, but extremely delicious throughout! At the beginning, I notice a minimal synthetic off-note from time to time, but really minimal.\nSo minimal that I almost didn't want to tell you.\nIt may also be due to the form of the day.\n\nPurely in terms of presentation, of course, an Angels' Share clone. In terms of scent, I don't necessarily think so, although the two are very similar.\nWhere Khamrah focuses on the sweet apple, the competitor focuses on cinnamon and vice versa.\nAlthough I must confess that I only own one bottling of Angels' Share.\nHowever, I would definitely also give it a certain boozy note!\nIt's obviously perfect for Christmas markets, Christmas parties and the entire Advent season.\nOtherwise also very versatile to wear if you don't overdo it with the quantity.\nDefinitely unisex.\n\nConclusion:\nAs known from many Lattafa fragrances, the price / performance of this representative is of course top notch! That's not the only reason why I always reach for the bottle, I like it! Nevertheless: Attention, very sweet...\nPackaging / presentation: Full marks, you could easily pay 5 times the price for this! Would - and will - clearly prefer it to its relatives (from Kilian)!"", ""Wow...\nI was afraid that this perfume again like the oud stories of Lataffa before Lauter oud and patchouli nothing else is perceptible and is much too coarse.\nBut I was in love from the first second.\nThe fragrance is not as loud as the above fragrances. He is quite perceptible and present but not intrusive and annoying.\nHe smells delicious and unique.\nIt definitely reminds of autumn and winter. Like a delicious Christmas scented candle only as a perfume.\nIt smells like Christmas cookies but pleasantly wearable. I'm not really a fan of smelling like food but it's really warm and nice.\nHe warms the heart when one is cold.\nFor everyday life suitable, work I do not know but evenings definitely also.\n\nCinnamon, nutmeg, spicy strong praline. A little sweet but spicy at the same time. The vanilla makes it warm.I'm not disappointed I'm so glad to have bought him yet after much deliberation. And the packaging and the bottle ... you just have to leave it there as a display."", ""I bought it because everyone was comparing it to Angels Share, but it's not. The only similarities are the gourmand vibe and the bottle.\nThe fragrance is really cool and I mean really good very good indeed. The perfume starts directly with the praline sitting on the date with some cinnamon on top. It's really, really delicious. Then comes vanilla which plays together with the tonka bean. The scent in general is sweet but not overpoweringly sweet that you get tired of it, it's really well rounded and fun to wear. It is a light sweetness, you could also say transparent sweetness, because it mixes with a light freshness that I unfortunately cannot describe\nThe presentation is simply top, so it couldn't really be better and the bottle itself looks really great. However, you have to make compromises with the lid because it's really weird to close and the sprayer is really very weak but it does its job.\n\nThe durability is above average. You get at least 8 hours of the perfume on the skin and also several days in the clothes. The perfume has a very good sillage, you are often asked about it and you notice the smell again and again.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this perfume. Whether you are a man or a woman, the fragrance suits both very well. An absolute unisex with a top price-performance ratio."", 'So far in my 2 years or so of my fragrance journey, and having sampled approximately 500 different fragrances, this is #1 for me in terms of the best value of any fragrance so far. Another reviewer described it as ""Christmas in a bottle"", and I couldn\'t agree more. While it\'s decidedly NOT a clone of Angels\' Share, I\'d say this is almost an ""inspired by"" fragrance with a...', ""After Interlude, Khamrah was the second fragrance that hit me like a nuclear bomb. You know immediately that this is something special. And every time you smell it again, your desire for a bottle grows. The benchmark for outstanding perfumes. As soon as your desire for a bottle grows, you know you've hit the jackpot again. This doesn't happen too often, but that's a good thing, because it has to remain something special.\n\nThe Khamrah came as a small bottling from my brother-in-law. It was so delicious, I would have loved to drink it. Something like a brandy, cognac-like, gourmand. It was the fall of '22 and there was already a little hype about it in the perfume world, it was nowhere to be found. If it was available online for a short time, you had to be quick, it was immediately out of stock again.\n\nThen I had it in December. A beautiful presentation, a great presentation, in which a high-quality, beautiful, cognac bottle-like flacon is set against a quasi-mirrored background in a wood-like box. And something in this price range. Compliments.\n\nWhen you wear it, you stand out. You'll be talked about.\nH/S at the top level.\nOf course it's a fall/winter fragrance, but I also wear it in other seasons because I would miss it otherwise. From 25 degrees onwards, however, it becomes too heavy and not only overwhelms you, but also the others.\n\nIncidentally, the fragrance pyramid on lattafa.de differs slightly. Unlike the pyramid published here, it lists cognac, among other things.\n\nI would currently call it no. 3 in my ranking."", ""Very disappointed. After all the mega enthusiastic reviews and videos I thought that was now my winter Christmas fragrance. But nope. First of all. The packaging is mega elegant. The bottle also. Only the plastic lid is a little stupid and does not go grad easy to.\nThen you spray. In the first seconds quite nice. Like an apple strudel that you have soaked in cognac or whiskey. Then ne quarter hour later, the arm smells like grandma's old wooden cabinet. Again a little later, it suddenly smells again slightly like apple pie, this time with some cinnamon in the cognac. This goes back and forth for a while and then everything is gone. In the meantime, I think it's me. Well. \u200d️ Does not last long. Stinks more than it smells and from the ingredients I can hardly recognize one."", 'The perfume Kamrah is truly a masterpiece in my opinion ( considering the low price well understood). Those who are not willing to pay the price for the Angels Share and are looking for a cheap alternative, but are well served by this.\nUnlike the Angels Share, however, a boozy rum note is completely missing here. So , Well enough of the comparison of two completely different fragrances.\n\nKamrah presents itself as a completely independent fragrance that takes you into a world of oriental dried fruits, seductive dates and a good pinch of cinnamon. This fragrance profile inevitably evokes memories of the magical winter season, where warm and sensual aromas play a special role.\n\nKamrah is a fragrance that seems like a poem of winter that envelops all those who wear it in the cold season. Its depth and complexity give it a magical aura, reminiscent of snowy landscapes and cozy fireplaces without reeking of smoke. Kamrah is undoubtedly an olfactory journey into the fairy-tale world of winter.\n\nI think Kamrah remains a faithful companion for several hours, even in cold weather, and I am confident that it will survive even a long evening at the Christmas market.', ""After hundreds of reviews and explicit recommendations on Tiktok and YT, I decided to buy the fragrance and was extremst gespannt.\nİch had always wondered how gourmandig and delicious should be taken up, which I had always read in reviews.\nAnd when the fragrance arrived, I finally understood what delicious could mean.\nMy father sprayed himself first. It was just to bite into, absolutely delicious. Really reminds you of a winter's day - you smell cinnamon, apple pie, vanilla (it kind of reminded me a bit of baklava şerbet - just seductive) - generally sweet yummy notes, but they are anything but strong and annoying.\n\nI absolutely loved the scent, but my problem with Khamrah is the longevity. İch could not even a whole hour the fragrance strongly perceived. Everything after 20 minutes were only so light perceptions.\nAfter 3-4 hours on the skin actually almost nothing.\nSillage was strangely enough on the skin of my father mega blatant. İch was positively surprised, what a broad scent cloud it leaves behind - I was in love. But with me max. 3/10.\n\nGenerally, therefore, very nice fragrance, with poor durability and also relatively weak sillage.\nContrary to all the reviews, the performance was with me so not so good, unfortunately. I try the fragrance also times with Vaseline."", ""In my search for a really sweet, gourmand Christmas fragrance, I inevitably stumbled across the recommendation for Khamrah. The descriptions of a cinnamon-praline Christmas market dream made me curious - that sounded exactly like the scent I was looking for! When it finally arrived, I was almost excited. Then the first spray and...confusion. Then disappointment. The one on my wrist didn't smell like Christmas and gourmand comfort at all, but more like an unspectacular, almost pretentious men's perfume. I blame the bergamot in the top note for this, as it inevitably reminds me of Dior Sauvage in every fragrance - and I really don't like it very much. So it's a purely personal problem on my part. I couldn't perceive cinnamon and nutmeg in the opening at all.\n\nSo I waited. And it was worth it. Within minutes, the fragrance transformed on my skin, becoming sweeter and softer. The jostling, synthetic-macho quality gave way to a cinnamon-sprinkled date praline on vanilla pudding. Gentle, sweet and almost sticky, without making you sick. There was also a certain fruitiness, the scent was reminiscent of a Christmas market - but also somehow of the confectionery department of a luxury department store at Christmas time: chocolates, fruit confectionery and spiced cookies. The vanilla makes its presence felt on the finish: it is clearly perceptible after a few hours of wear and dominates.\n\nLongevity is really good (still absolutely perceptible after 8 hours of wear) and it also radiates without being overpowering - but I think you should spray with caution.\nI am positively surprised by this blind purchase, but it should be mentioned here that it really is a unisex fragrance that is slightly masculine. But for adult women who don't like it too playful and girly, it's definitely wearable."", 'Anyone who likes sweet fragrances is in good hands with Khamrah.\nWhen I sprayed it on for the first time, I immediately knew that this fragrance would accompany me through the cold days.\nYou are enveloped in a cozy warmth that almost makes your mouth water.\nThe date definitely dominates here, bedded on a praline, which is then surrounded by a slightly cinnamony vanilla tonka coat.\nDefinitely a gourmand fragrance that is sweet but not too overpowering.\nKhamrah has become my winter comfort fragrance par excellence, like a sweet veil that envelops me and gives me a feeling of security and warmth.\n\nThe longevity and the price-performance ratio are simply outstanding. It is definitely perceptible for a relaxed 8 hours, which is longer on clothing.\nA clear recommendation from me!', ""I've had the Lattafa Kamrah for 3 days now and spray it on every day. It took some getting used to on the first day, as I'm not used to such oriental/gourmand scents.\n\nNow it's day 3 and I'm loving it! It starts off very, very sweet - stays that way until the end, just a little less sweet. The start is still not my thing, but as soon as the heart note appears, the Kamrah is really, really good and has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances - at least for the winter.\nSince the fragrance is really sweet, I think it's more suitable for fall/winter. Maybe spring in the evening, but less so in summer. Although vanilla is apparently present in the base note, I notice this flavor very early on - which is an absolute plus for me.\n\nI can imagine the perfume on women and men, in my opinion it suits both equally.\n\nLongevity and sillage are very good - you can feel it all day long, beautifully enveloped in a sweet, feel-good cloud.\n\nThe bottle is beautiful and solid. The lid, on the other hand, is cheaply made and the atomizer is not my thing: doesn't spray as nicely and in too narrow a stream.\n\nI'm amazed at the quality, especially as I only paid CHF 60 for it - I have other fragrances that are far more expensive and give less - be it the fragrance itself, the durability or the sillage. In my opinion, the price/performance ratio is absolutely top."", 'Khamrah eröffnet mit einem feinen Hauch Alkohol, dazu gibt es den Duft einer Vanille-lastigen Damen Body Lotion doch sobald sich die Ethanol Note verflüchtigt hat, bleibt ein immer lieblicher und lecker werdender Duft.\n\nSeit ich zum ersten Mal bei einem Kompliment den Vergleich zu Bratapfel hörte, löst sich diese Assoziation nicht mehr aus meinem Kopf.\nDer Duft hat für mich seinen absoluten Höhepunkt zwischen einer Stunde nach Auftragen und 9-10 Stunden später....AUF DER HAUT!\n\nSo einen langlebiger Geruch für diesen Preis sieht man wirklich nicht alle Tage.\nAbsolut toll für die kalte Jahreszeit, insbesondere den Winter.', ""Often I have read that Khamrah awakens associations with the pre-Christmas period. And I can quite understand why this fragrance in our latitudes to think of snowy mountains, Christmas markets and hot mulled wine.\n\nBut when I smell Khamrah, I am immediately catapulted to Arabia. In my mind's eye, this fragrance creates a hot dune landscape. In the middle of this wasteland is a small oasis. Magnificent date trees grow here, exuding their honey-sweet scent. A shady spot invites you to rest. It is time for a hot Tässchen, sweet black tea and something spice cake in addition.\n\nThe variety of these flavors envelops my senses. Spicy and strong at the beginning and gentle and delicate as it progresses. Khamrah is a faithful companion who remains at my side until darkness falls. An upright Arabian prince just like from 1001 Nights."", ""Is Christmas, granny is busy preparing cinnamon rolls with rum and raisins, you abruptly open the kitchen door, and the scent hit you...and that is exactly how this perfume smell....well....lets elaborate.\nThis fragrance opens with a sweet blend of dates and cinnamon.

Sometimes not that great, but mostly amazing and well done.\nI bought mine for 38 euros, in some places cost twice, but if you look in the right places you will find it for a good price.\nIn case you are wondering my fav Lataffa scents are: Badee al Oud, Raghba wood intense and Kahmrah."", ""I bought it as an alternative to Angels Share and was totally surprised. With its gourmand cinnamon bun scent, it is very similar to its role model, but it also has deviations, which I don't see as negative at all. A date is added, which makes the fragrance a little less round, but all the more exciting as a result. It takes its time, becoming more and more pleasant and vanilla-like. As usual with Lattafa, the longevity and sillage are above average, I find 2 sprays to be optimal. In terms of price, you can do anything but complain...\nAll in all, a wonderful fragrance that I wore mainly during the holidays. An insider tip from me is to layer it with SWYI."", 'Touted by many as a dupe to Angels Share, but in reality a fragrance DNA of its own without alcohol and with an imposing date in a very similar bottle.\n\nThe fragrance is gourmand, sweet and delicious, like a warm dessert on cold days. Super fragrance for the winter, price performance is unbeatable with this fragrance in my opinion!', ""The first spray is so damn good, it dries down to a very vanilla-heavy scent with something else , it's sweet but warm and mysteriously nostalgic. There's a slightly grassy note in there, hiding somewhere under the vanilla. It's like vanilla liqueur on a cozy winter evening. To be honest, it just smells fantastic. Fresh, warm, spicy and sweet. It's a very addictive smell for me...."", ""It smells like a fall candle, even my sister asked who was burning a candle after I applied it haha. It's not terrible or anything but.... I don't really want to smell like a candle. FYI it's not a dupe for angels share nor is it close IMO, it's just a similar genre of scent. It becomes a kinda spicy vanilla after a while. Good lasting power and sillage, not worth the increased price."", ""Khamrah is a standalone beautiful scent that is not a clone of Angels' Share!\nAt first spray I get a cinnamon that is softened with the light flower of tuberose (I hate tuberose but I love it in this) The scent then turns very sweet, dense, and boozy! An addictingly rich praline and date combination. It is love at first sniff! I blind bought this for under $30 on TikTok shop."", ""I actually wanted to get the Khamrah from Lattafa because so many people think it's so similar to the famous Angels Share, but I can't say that it is. AS is good, but the Khamrah is simply better for me. It's a dream for the colder months. I am very happy to have bought this great winter gourmand. It was love at first smell! H/S are really top here too, if I spray it on in the morning it really lasts me all day."", 'The Arabic word ""khamrah"" means alcohol or intoxicating drink. And even if the similarity to AngelsShare is only limited, it describes this fragrance very well. Intoxicating, beguiling and, above all, highly addictive.

The vanilla and the date are also perceptible throughout the fragrance.\n\nThe H/L is very good. The fragrance lasts over 8 hours on my skin and radiates beautifully.

It is an extremely powerful, explosive and dominant perfume. A very sweet, warm, even hot and flamy one. Everytime I apply it I cough a little bit for a couple of seconds. I am not allergic or anything, it\'s just the perfume is really, really powerful. It fills up the space where you are while applying it and behaves like a high-end air freshner for a good 30 minutes or so. It is perfect for freezing nights and really cold mornings. The ladies like it, people often ask me what perfume I am wearing, and they highly compliment it. It is strange and mysterious. Just don\'t spray too much, because, besides being a master piece, Kharma is an aggressive perfume.', ""It's been a while since i wrote a review so i may be a little rusty but spraying it on this morning inspired me to write something about it as these images popped in to my mind and warmed my heart.\n\nThis fragrance has invoked a feeling of well being, images of coming home to a loved one after a day of being out doing fun things and your love has been baking some sweet apple pie for you to both share over a nice cup of tea or coffee while discussing the great things you have both been doing all day. I imagine a beautiful house in the woods surrounded by snow, coming in to a warm, loving home with the fire on and the feeling of someone being there happy to see you as you are to see them. And if they smell you wearing this, i am sure they will be wanting to pull you in close for a welcoming hug.\n\nIt is sweet, creamy and again has this warmth that radiates from the body, mine being my chest where i sprayed it only twice.\n\nI really can't believe the price of this fragrance, for what it costs it is better than some of the £300+ fragrances i have been testing at times. It can be hard to get because of its popularity and when you first get it, it does need a little time to become it's full potential, but once the kinks are worked out it becomes something so beautiful that you don't want to run out of it ever. Like a blossoming love that when done correctly becomes something truly wonderful to experience. The perfumer creating this definitely knew what they were doing to make such a wonderful fragrance at such a price, which was about £40 when i bought it.\n\nIf you can get this fragrance, or it is hard to get where you are, I suggest putting it on some sort of alert when it is back in stock because this is one worth the wait and when you get it you will understand why and not want it out of your collection ever again.\n\nThis definitely up there in my top list of the best fragrances i own.\n\nI almost forgot to mention just how beautiful the bottle and box it comes in. This is one that will be up front and centre of your display because you are proud to own it.\n\nThe longevity is great, i remember times waking up and thinking oh who is baking something today? It smells so good, and then realizing it is the fragrance i had put on the previous day.\n\nProjection is also great. Just 2 sprays to the chest and i can smell it as clear as day. No need to be spraying this on the wrists to check every so often, you are aware of it all day, and this is not a fragrance i find so strong to the point i become nose blind from it.\n\nIt is a great winter fragrance, but you can wear this all year round, as the sweetness is not too overpowering and feeling like you are drenched in some sort of syrup poured over you at a drunken party.

The sweetness is joined by a somewhat ""boozy"" note, but I can\'t quite put my finger on what it reminds me of. Rum? Apple cider? There\'s something synthetic behind it. Personally, I don\'t detect any myrrh or wood, but if I do, it\'s all suppressed or overwhelmed by this extreme cinnamon-sweet-alcohol combo.\n\nThe fragrance projects so extremely that it is almost somehow unpleasant.

In my opinion Khamrah is a very nice scent, but Angels' Share is still a bit warmer, rounder, and better.\n\nThey're closest in the beginning, because both start out with a very intense cinnamon note, warm vanilla and fruitiness. While Angels' Share doesn't have any fruit notes listed, it reminds me of dried apple slices. Khamrah on the other hand smells like the listed dates. They both give me a warm, wintery, cozy and snug feeling. And that's where the similarities end.\nIn the drydown, Khamrah doesn't get quite as warm and gourmand as Angels' Share. It's sweet, but it also has strong woodsy notes and a transparent booziness. I can also sense the praline and something vaguely floral, so it has a bit more of a designer perfume feel. The base reminds me a little bit of Kayali Invite Only Amber, it has a similar texture. I do like both of them, but this booziness is not 100% my thing.\n\nSorry for writing more of a comparison instead of a regular review, it's always hard not to do that when something is regarded as a dupe for a more famous fragrance that you also have a decant of.\nAnyways, I think Khamrah is a great choice if you're looking for a warming cinnamon scent and don't want to spend a fortune."", 'On really cold days, when you look at the thermometer and realize: ""oh, today I\'d better put on a thicker jacket"", this fragrance offers everything I need.\n\nSlightly sweetish alcohol note at the beginning, transforms relatively quickly into a pleasant cinnamon note.\n\nVanilla and a warm woody note accompany me in the further course of the fragrance.\n\nIn terms of durability:\n10-12 hours but quite easy (actually a madness for the price).\n\nSillage:\nMaybe next time only 3 sprays (you might smell it at the other end of the aisle).\n\nBut from the feedback, only positive responses.\n\nAn absolute blind-buy in terms of price-performance ratio.\n\nKind regards,\nPlain text', ""The nice thing is that I got it as an Angles Share alternative,\nWithout knowing exactly what Kilian smells like.\nI think the fragrance is mega good.\nI only read very often afterwards that it doesn't smell like the A.S.\nAnd there will be something to it, because the Khamrah definitely does not have an alcoholic note.\nIf you're looking for an Angles Share..... hands off.\nIf you're just looking for something similar that smells great and lasts a long time in winter....\nDefinitely a recommendation to buy.\nIn any case, I'm not sad about having bought it and it doesn't quite come close to Angles Share."", ""Since I've recently become a big fan of gourmand, sweet winter fragrances, and the khamra has been advertised by various perfume influencers as the absolute price-performance champion, I thought it would be interesting to get a sample from the souk.

It smells like a warm cinnamon bun that has just come out of the oven. It has an extreme sweetness and the very pregnant cinnamon note extends beyond the opening, more or less over the entire wearing time of this perfume. Personally, I didn't notice much of the somewhat harsher notes listed in the base of the fragrance pyramid. However, as I quickly discovered, this is not for me. I find the sweetness of Khamra so overwhelming that I could hardly bear to wear it for a whole day. It's like real cinnamon buns, which I can only eat in very small doses haha.

I think the hype around this fragrance is more so a product of youtube influencers rather than actual merit.\nThis is incredibly synthetic and unnatural in a very very sweet headache inducing way. The main problem is that they compromise the balance of the scent with too much synthetic ingredients because they want to prioritize performance. For the price, I understand that it can be difficult to create a quality scent with good performance, but in my opinion, scent should always come first. To be fair, I´m not the biggest fan of the original AS, because that fragrance itself is quite synthetic and clearly overpriced for what it is.\nAnyways, if you are looking for true masterpieces in this genre that are worth the money I would point you to PDM Oajan or even XJ Naxos.\ndisclaimer:this review is not meant to offend anyone.', 'This fragrance is simply a stunner and bomb for 40€.\nA double whammy, so to speak.\nCardboard-sweet fragrance that surrounds a warm plum/date with vanilla and cinnamon.

Overall, the entire fragrance is characterized by a strong sweetness. This makes the fragrance rather one-dimensional, but the sweetness is admittedly also pleasantly heavy and sensual. It is not particularly synthetic either.\n\nThe fragrance is definitely something for the evening or for going out, perhaps also for a date. It needs cold temperatures, otherwise it would really be too much with its heavy sweetness. What's more, the Khamrah also has a feminine twist thanks to this very sweetness, although it is still grown-up.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are very good, especially for the price range in which the Khamrah is found. This also results in a pretty good price-performance ratio.\n\nEspecially for its price, I think you can both try this fragrance and buy it blind if you like very sweet scents."", ""Sugar Orient Bomb\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that I don't know Angels Share by Killian in real life.

Here it should be said that this is not cheap plastic ala deodorant bottle cap, but high-quality plastic.\n\nChristmas market time at the time of the review. Stalls with the smell of sugar and roasted almonds. That's what you can expect at Khamrah.\n\nSweet, heavy. Sweet, but with a certain depth. The fragrance is composed in such a way that although the sweetness and a certain similarity to marzipan is recognizable, it also has depth.\n\nThis sweet praline and honey gorumand vibe is what characterizes this fragrance. Heavy, sweet, but damn good.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are more than good. Absolutely top for this price range. Better dose carefully, if there are diabetics around you, you could get a sugar shock ;-)"", ""When I smelled the Khamra for the first time, I didn't like it right away, it has nothing to do with the Angels Share, for me it is much too sweet an almost pungent sweet so that it is unfortunately almost not wearable for me, durability and sillage are top for the price (as you know it from Lataffa), but the bottle is of weak quality, the lid broke after a few weeks. In conclusion, it has nothing to do with Angels Share and is too sweet for me."", ""I bought the perfume as a blind buy (I know....), but it was a complete success. The top note of the perfume is fruity, in my opinion it smells a bit like sweet (baked) apple, even though it's not in the fragrance pyramid. After a while, it develops into a pleasant vanilla scent. It definitely makes you feel like you're at a Christmas market. I can't say much about H/S yet, as I only got it about 1.5 hours ago and applied it for the first time. For the price, I wouldn't mind a less strong H/S, although according to the other reviews it should last quite a long time. Definitely a buy recommendation for the winter."", ""Omg where do I even begin?? This just smells like the most delicious, sweet yet spicy cinnamon and caramell dessert ever! I weirdly get cinnamon apple pie from this, though this doesn’t have any apple notes in it. I can definitely pick up on the sweetness from the date and vanilla as well as the spiciness from the cinnamon, nutmeg and myrrh. I actually also get a little bit of smokiness in the base, I'm guessing from that roasted tonka bean? It just smells absolutely addicting and super sexy to me with the spiciness and almost a bit leathery! Definitely nothing for the warmer months and also very strong! It literally lasts days if not weeks on my clothes and also has great projection! So, if you don't like sweet and spicy thiccc gourmand scents, stay far away from this one!"", 'Sweet and delicious. Smells of baked apple and Christmas cookies, which makes it very good for cozy winter evenings with the family. Longevity and sillage are very good, which is not unusual for sweet winter fragrances. Price performance is okay. The fragrance is not bad but also nothing special, which unfortunately does not live up to its hype (especially on TikTok). Kamrah...', ""I was introduced to this perfume by my brother. He was surprised by the scent himself and had to show it to me. A very sweet, oriental and strong fragrance for fall or winter. It reminds me a lot of an oriental dessert called Künefe. Definitely a must-have for me for special occasions. I'll get it this year.\n\nAbout the fragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a sweet, oriental and cinnamon scent. The cinnamon scent then fades a little and then turns into a vanilla scent. The cinnamon scent clearly dominates. The fragrance reminds me of a dessert called Künefe. I'm sure some of you know this dessert.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a good, strong oriental perfume for special occasions in the fall or winter, you can't go wrong here. For just under 40 euros, you get a super sweet and strong oriental fragrance for fall and winter. Note: For me, the fragrance is strong, so I will wear it for special occasions. But it can also change. You get used to some fragrances.""]"

The scent is sweet-spicy. It is being marketed by LVMH.  ,['male'],"['Nathalie Lorson', 'Olivier Cresp']","['Sweet', 'Spicy', 'Powdery', 'Woody', 'Creamy']",['Italian bergamot'],"['Chestnut', 'Italian iris concrete', 'Benzoin Siam']","['Indonesian patchouli', 'Virginia cedar', 'Haitian vetiver']",8.3,7.9,7.6,8.1,7.9,"['I am lucky enough to be able to enjoy this perfume quite fast after its release and I can say that I smiling and keep sniffing my wrist all the time since I sprayed it this morning.\n\nIt starts very pleasant and familiar, with iris, bergamot and a slight boozy note .. the familiarity comes from the Florentine Iris present in DHP, which has a similar opening. This is for my nose almost identical with DIOR Homme Intense 2017, pre-reformulation version .. less powerful of course, but as intense and beautiful.\n\nThe chestnut and the benzoin, are shy and hide behind the multiple Iris notes but keep the character of the perfume quite romantic and classy. I do not smell any vetiver but there is a beautiful high quality cedar note in the dry down, making it even more classier if that can be possible.\n\nAfter about 20-30 min it becomes a very addictive smell (if you like LVMH Iris scents) which reminds me very much of DHP without the stinky leather, which to be honest it´s a total no go for me.\n\nThis is far from a ""new"" release, but very close to DIOR Homme I/P pre-Reformulation scent DNA. As we know, Givenchy and DIOR are both part of LVMH so for me this is a very smart move from them .. to take over the perfume world with DHP as the Original bad boy, and create a well behaved brother called Réserve Privée and make it a Givenchy.\n\nFor the price, quality and smell .. this is a 9/10 creation. 1 point goes off because it is a copy paste DHP without the leather.', 'Now this smells very nice indeed with the fresh iris in the opening that soon has chocolate facets. The whisky adds a nice subtle dimension to the scent and pairs well with the chocolate tinged Iris.\n\nAs time moves forward the scent becomes woody and nutty from the chestnut. Here it begins to get sweeter and powdery with what smells like a hint of caramel melded with the woods.\n\nI get several hour longevity on the skin and very average projection. Within arms length for the first hour dropping to within half a arms length after. It is a scent that stays close to you.\n\nAll in all a delight!', 'I thought about it for a long time. Should I really buy it? Do I really like it that much? Isn\'t it too sweet for me? And so I sniffed this fragrance again and again, pondered and then ultimately left it on the shelf. Until that one fateful Black Friday. It\'s the year 2023 and, like every year, I see lots of messages about various offers two days before ""Black Friday"". My inner anti-capitalist just wrinkles his nose. ""I\'m not going to take part"" I say to myself. Long story short: I bought it after all. On Black Friday. At full price. And I couldn\'t be happier about this decision. After this far too long intro, here\'s a brief summary of why I\'m so happy with this fragrance.\n\nFlacon:\n\nThe bottle is nice and heavy, slightly rounded as with every fragrance in the Gentleman range and fits well in the hand. I really love the color gradient of the glass from black to brown to transparent. For me, this color gradient makes it by far the most beautiful bottle in the whole range.\n\nFragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a very present whisky note, which actually reminds me of a nice glass on the couch in the evening. Despite the strong sweetness, the fragrance never becomes unpleasant or pungent, which for me is also due to the beautiful iris and chestnut. Both blend in very well and make the fragrance incredibly soft. In the drydown, it then loses some of its sweetness and becomes woodier without changing its basic orientation significantly. You could say the fragrance is linear. This is perhaps true in comparison to other fragrances, but this simplicity is incredibly fitting here in particular. It seems reduced to the essentials, calm, elegant, serene without the urge to really stand out.\n\nSillage:\n\nStriking is a good keyword. Because if you want to stand out, you can stop reading at this point and look for an alternative. Or keep reading and simply spray a little more. Joking aside, Réserve Privee really doesn\'t have a brute sillage. However, like its aforementioned simplicity, this is what makes it what it is: an incredibly sophisticated fragrance that you don\'t wear if you want to stand out, but rather if you know how to make your fragrance blend in perfectly with the rest of your appearance. If this fragrance were a person, it would be much more Ben Bernschneider than Andrew Tate and since I like the former much more than the latter, I can make this comparison with a clear conscience.\n\nDurability:\n\nThe shelf life of the Gentleman is probably the only point where I really have something to complain about. And even that is complaining at a high level. The fragrance lasts a reasonably long time, but I would still like a fragrance with this rather inconspicuous sillage to last a little longer, because after about 6-8 hours you can really only smell it very subtly. In my opinion, this also distinguishes it from similarly designed fragrances such as Dior Homme Intense (2011). While the latter can still be clearly smelled after 8-10 hours, the Gentleman is more or less just a nice memory at this point. It\'s not tragic, but that\'s also part of the truth.\n\nPrice:\nI don\'t need to say much about the price. For 50-60€, this is pretty much the finest fragrance you can imagine, so the price/performance ratio is almost unbeatable.\n\nConclusion/overall impression:\n\nThe fragrance does a hell of a lot right. If you are looking for an alternative to Dior Homme Intense (2011) with a nice alcohol note, you should definitely take a closer look at this one. For me, it is still a perfect fragrance for fall and milder winter days. Cozy, relaxed and yet classy. What a beautiful creation!', ""This fragrance. It's everything. Beautiful, sexy, dark, alluring, one would even say unisex (makeup purse vibe, maybe more swanky leather vibe from the iris) but don't let that deter you. This stuff is the best scent I've smelled in years. When you wear this, men will be jealous of you. Women will just make a face like you owe them something THEY NEED. This stuff is ALLURING, for sure. You want to make someone look your way? Look no further..."", 'Although I have now been moving for some time in the perfume community and already heard many tips and could gather experience on the subject, I let myself get carried away here to a blind buy. Fortunately, however, this was worth it.\n\nTouted on many channels as the ultimate fall fragrance, the fragrance caught my eye during a visit to a perfumery. Actually, I was determined to buy another fragrance. After this but on the day was not available, is the Gentlemen, influenced by the positive reports, after a short test on the fragrance strip bought.\n\nEnough preliminary skirmish, we come to the most important. How does the fragrance actually smell?\nIn the opening, the fragrance starts with beautiful, warm notes. I find despite the listed bergamot you can not really perceive citric notes. We have here a beautiful iris, which unfolds together with a chestnut note and underpinned by an alcoholic, Boozy note.\nThe chestnut I find very interesting and find that it fits well in the fragrance DNA.\nThe fragrance is rounded off with vetiver and patchouli.\n\nThe shelf life is with me at a good 6-7 hrs.\nThe sillage has enough power that your counterpart perceives the fragrance. But I do not find that it is too strong or almost already slaying.\n\nThe best time to wear the fragrance I see in the coming, cold season.\nHere he can score with his warm notes.\nThe best occasions for the Réserve Privée are dates or evenings with friends in a relaxed atmosphere.\nIn the office, the fragrance will certainly not tick off negatively, but I find for this there are better alternatives.\n\nThe rather dark design of the bottle fits well with the fragrance. Otherwise, the bottle is kept relatively simple. In gold lettering, the name and the Givenchy logo are held.\n\nPrice-wise, the fragrance is currently about 55€ for 60ml, which I think is absolutely reasonable.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThe many recommendations to this fragrance I can well understand. The combination of iris, chestnut and the whiskey note fits really well together. Just the whiskey lifts him again from other fragrances that also work with iris notes, I find.\nA test he is worth in any case and maybe he pulls even in one or the other collection.', 'Finally sampling one of the most recent releases from Givenchy, Gentleman Eau de Parfum Reserve Privee, that’s been understandably getting a lot of positive attention. I’m not deeply familiar with Givenchy in general nor the expansive Gentleman line but I wanted to try this, and I’m glad I did.

The baby cat plays on a velvet blanket and knocks over a small bowl of tonka beans.\n\nIn the opening, the fragrance smells sooo similar to Velvet Tonka , that I assure myself several times not to have grabbed the wrong AF. I actually have both fragrances :)\nConclusion: Opening 1:1 of the Velvet Tonka. The fragrance pyramids of the two fragrances are not 1:1 similar to each other.... now I\'m confused.\n\nTonka, vanilla, marzipan... sweet incense spice!\n\nIn the drydown, it becomes smokier and a bit peppery again.

Nothing new.\n\nAfter 2 hours, it is still beautiful... and still Velvet Tonka.\n\nAlso the durability and sillage is good!\n\nConclusion: a fragrance twin. bdk is according to research appeared 1 year before ysl, consequently ysl has ""stibitzt"".\n\nBasically, I find it a bit of a shame that it is a fragrance twin - the special is somehow lost there.\nI like fragrances in the niche - and higher price segment, which are at most slightly similar, but at all times ""stand for themselves"".

I could post the contents of the review to Velvet Tonka as well. Aaaaaber, he still gets its own review.\n\nIs a great autumn-winter fragrance, but there is already from BDK. Therefore, also something deduction in the fragrance rating', ""As someone already mentioned, it's just a full blast of incense. Peppery at the beginning, then comes the incense, and very darkly you can sense some saffron, and then vanilla, which tends to stay in the background. All of this with a very linear progression overall. Be sure to test the fragrance first!"", ""Babycat - what does that make me think of? A small furry creature with big eyes that finds it difficult to control itself. It rolls around and claws the handler's finger in play.\n\nBaby cats are cute! And that's why they can be forgiven for their other sides: they don't always wet the litter, they bite, they climb up your clothes and chew the skin of the person you're with. The watery nose and crusty eyes should not be missing from the list.\n\nTheir smell is not just pleasant either. In addition to the furry, delicate, baby-like cat smell, they bring a hint of cat food with them.\n\nIn this respect, I find the concept of YSL Babycat not entirely coherent. (Whether it would have needed a different name or a different content - it doesn't matter) The fragrance of the perfume is not ambivalent, not awkward, not babyish, not animalistic, not playful. You can smell a consistently pleasing, slightly masculine, vanilla scent.\n\nBut here in detail: the vanilla is always present, but does not play to the fore. It is roughened with pepper and cedar, resulting in a very harmonious interplay. The strong sweetness finds an interesting balance with the hard incense after the top notes have faded. In the end, it is just sweet-gourmand.\n\nI can very well understand the association with melted rubber that someone described. But that's a bit of a mean assessment. Because the intensity of this olfactory impression does not drift off into the unpleasant or synthetic.\n\nPersonally, I'm not so fond of the vanillin note and the very sweetness. The performance of the Babycat struck me as positive and I also liked the development. It's not my taste, but if you like vanilla, you'll like this one.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say anything about price performance, as I'm not familiar with this price segment. An alternative might be the Prada Luna Rossa, which is much cheaper, but in my opinion not much worse.\n\nConditional recommendation - if you like vanilla and don't mind the money."", ""Over 600 fragrance reviews for a fragrance that hasn't been on the market that long and isn't available in every perfumery around the corner? You could really call that hype. One that I honestly can't understand. There are much better and more sophisticated vanilla fragrances, even in combination with incense. Lune Féline EAU DE PARFUM comes to mind spontaneously - without incense, but in a similar vein. Also somewhat similar is Leder 6 by Schwarzlose. I don't want to denigrate the fragrance, but I think that alongside many very positive reviews, there should also be room for a somewhat more neutral opinion.\n\nNow to the fragrance: I would have expected a complex, multi-layered fragrance with a progression. One with a clear sillage, mysterious, heavy and noble.\nWhat I got: Incense, leather and vanilla. No more, no less. No great development, seems a bit cobbled together to me.

The Isola Blu starts with a nice fresh citrus, without being too boringly fresh. In the dry down, the fragrance develops more and more depth and becomes a bit spicier and even develops a slight woodiness for me. In short, really nice! But for me, it\'s just not worth the money.... According to my nose, it is simply the nobler, more complex and deeper Bleu de Chanel. A good fragrance, no question, but I just can\'t justify paying so much for such a fragrance. For this he blows me by far not enough from the stool.\n\nNor is it a ""summer in a bottle"" scent for me. Due to the spice / depth / woodiness I see him rather in the spring or even autumn, but not on the really hot days.

(Now I have an almost full one)\n\nWhy did I regret it?\n\nI really liked the consistent and different way. Because he doesn\'t just keep it short with 1,2,3 citrusy notes and with 1,2 flowers like most do (some better and some less good) , but he takes a different approach.\n\nThe second (interesting) back story:\n\nI have heard it this way (several times, let me correct it if it is wrong), the oligarch was no longer allowed to be called oligarch because of the Russia - Ukraine conflict and therefore due to certain ""ambiguities"", therefore he was hired and in his place came the Isola Blu, which was (noticeably) adapted - but more about that later!\nWhat is the old Oligarch (perfume) actually like?\nAt the end of the day, it\'s enough to say citrusy, slightly metallic and insanely complex, but that alone doesn\'t do it justice. We have here a good portion of fresh and fruity citrus in an XXL portion (and that is not an understatement) in a high-quality, beautiful, noble and NOT synthetic vein.\n\nAfter that comes my ""LOVE PHASE"", then something quite crazy happens, the citrus bomb becomes a Reflection Man many, many years ago - in 2015/ 2016 they said something like clean, metallic cold and almost sterile (but in beautiful!) and combination makes it a real masterpiece - so much for the impression and the realization!\n\nThe comparison!\n\nThe back story is well known, now to the Isola Blu. In the course of the adjustment and adaptation according to IFRA, it felt completely renewed and much was replaced and much is now noticeably on a synthetic basis. That doesn\'t have to be a bad thing - certainly not, with an extremely good tuning it can be very good. I don\'t want to (!) say that Roja Dove has done it wrong, but the Isola Blu has a somewhat.... on the one hand, they went the entry-level friendly route and the synthetic notes in the Isola Blu are not mine!\nSo if you do, then use an old Oligarch as a perfume and NOT Isola Blu. A comparison almost borders on an oligarch insult^^.\n\nHow is it received:\n\nMy old oligarch back then as well as my current oligarch from 2021 (one of the last!) are really incredibly well received. Whether women or men in the age range of 20, 40 or 60+, all of them love it!\nWhen and where to wear it?\n\nYes, I could now say office and yes that would definitely fit, but it really always goes and always fits (no matter what season or occasion), if there is still enough of it in the formula as a perfume I would get 10 bottles! That\'s how good I think it is!\nIf I really wasn\'t convinced, I wouldn\'t recommend it to you!\n\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', 'I\'ve wanted to try the Roja fragrances for a long time. Or at least a few of them. When I looked at the fragrance pyramids, I kept thinking about what these perfumes must smell like if they have so many different ingredients.\n\nWith ""Isola Blu (perfume) / Oligarch (perfume) | Roja Parfums"", I now know what it smells like. I wanted to try it once before. Back then it was still called Oligarch. The name was quickly replaced. But then I couldn\'t find it again. I probably didn\'t look hard enough. In the meantime, I forgot that I wanted to try this fragrance. But now the time had come.\nThe Isola Blu PARFUM begins with a very fine, not at all pungent, but tangy and fruity citrus. This citrus is the reason why I also find that the fragrance smells a little fruity. In between, it is a little soapy and spicy, but just right. However, it is very multi-layered and becomes a little heavier and also a little sweet as it progresses. Frankly speaking, however, it is extremely difficult to recognize certain fragrance notes. You might think that this fragrance is almost perfectly blended when you think about how many different ingredients are listed here. And you don\'t get the feeling that any two components are clashing and don\'t smell right, nor do you get the feeling that it\'s all too much of a good thing. Because the fragrance is not overpowering. It is still pleasantly gentle.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that it has little power. Its longevity and sillage are very good for a fresh, citrusy fragrance. It wears well in spring and summer, preferably on a man. I also find that it can be worn almost regardless of the occasion. I could even imagine wearing a delicate spritz of it to the gym, if my already expensive little bottle wasn\'t too expensive for that. The only thing that speaks against ordering this fragrance immediately is its really high price.\n\nBut it is an absolutely first-class fragrance. You should have smelled Isola Blu PARFUM at some point.', 'Isola Blu is a typical Roja fragrance with many scents.\nHere too, however, the overall picture is good.\nIt doesn\'t overwhelm, but simply fits together well.\nWith Isola Blu, we naturally get a fragrance that is perfect for spring or summer.\nCitrus-fresh impressions, pleasantly spicy & greenish.\n\nThe fragrance features lime as the main player in the top note.\nA perceived mixture of lime juice and lime zest.\nThere is also some bergamot and lemon.\n\nOver time, a very subtle ""sweetness"" is added. Furthermore, floral notes add a certain depth and fit perfectly into the overall picture.\nThere is also a slightly soapy impression, as well as a greenish vibe and a great matching spiciness.\n\nTowards the end, pleasant woody impressions are added.\n\nMany people always claim to get associations with toilet cleaner and co.\nI can really only begin to understand that.\n\nAll in all, this is a Roja that I really like a lot.\nIn summer it\'s just ""awesome"".', 'Oligarch is a fragrance for a true oligarch, who spends summer vacations on his yacht in the most enchanting locations overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.\nFresh, citrusy, crisp and aromatic.\nAs in all Roja creations, it is difficult to separate the various notes that compose them, but I can say that juniper, citrus and pink pepper are well perceived.\nThe woody structure holds all the volatile components very well, providing truly remarkable longevity for the type of fragrance.\nDespite not being a lover of the genre, I must say that I like it very much: it is fresh, clean, but at the same time has depth.\n\n14 Swarovski cap, engravings and gold plate.\n\nPPS: Oligarch was discontinued due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and was put back on the market under the name of ""Isola Blu""...

I find the Isola Blu a little more citrusy in the opening, while the Basso is greener, almost chewy to my nose. After 30 minutes, they become more and more similar.

F** mania of the brands in loading their current perfumes with this stinging note.\n\nWhat do we get out of it? Turn what could have been a denser tropical fragrance, with more body, perceptible nuances, evolution and ""fine"", into something ""rough"", dominated by an excessive sweetness, strident, a global something repetitive, trite, disco and typical of a teenage and noisy age group, like Scandal (never better said).\n\nThe drying after about 3 hours is more pleasant and bearable with that woody / amber base, where sandalwood is well appreciated, perhaps what it should have been from the beginning (personal taste) and avoid that amount of tonka bean so sharp that, far from improving, covers everything else.\n\nI stay, by far, with his sister eau de toilette, who did not invent anything new, which yes, is also sweet, but certainly does not make you diabetic after using it.\n\nIn any case, if you like very sweet, fruity / woody perfumes with that type of profile, try it', 'My constant search for beautiful summer fragrances made me stumble upon the Le Beau.\n\nA beautiful bottle, fruity accords and the epitome of a tropical summer for me - the coconut - sounded very promising!\n\nThe first time I smelled it, I was actually very taken.

After a quick look at the notes, confirmation => very similar to Amarige by Givency. Same vibe and since Amarige was released in 1991, you don\'t have to think twice about who copied from whom. The retro vibe seems to be in demand at the moment, for nostalgic reasons I recently bought Amarige again after more than 20 years, I don\'t need two almost identical fragrances, especially as I find Amarige\'s bottle more beautiful. There is also a little Shalimar. Or Armani My Way. Or Born in Roma. You see, no groundbreaking innovation here.\nNot a shy fragrance either, an intense, gourmand fall and winter fragrance for women over 30. An initially fruity, then beguiling, floral fragrance.\nGourmand in the drydown, but not too heavy or overwhelming.\nDefinitely a woman\'s fragrance. You have to like jasmine and vanilla. Juicy sweet fruits and flowers; a suitable companion for the romantic cuddle time, some festive decadence, cold and wet outside and warm punch and dimmed lights inside. Vanilla, ambergris and jasmine cannot be denied a certain commercial character. This fragrance is by no means an office or travel fragrance and can trigger migraines. The sillage is above average and so is the longevity.\nFeminine, floral, powdery, sweet and intense.\nFor many, the fragrance will evoke ""I\'ve smelled it before"", it is not unique or one-of-a-kind, which would have been the case if pear had been made more prominent. You have to be very careful and not overdose here. I would have liked to have smelled old Paradoxe from 1983 by Pierre Cardin, it is supposed to be chypre-like and floral with pepper and moss.\nParadoxe 2022 is by no means shy, discreet or suitable for the office. Mainstream going out fragrance.\nIf I hadn\'t bought Amarige, Paradoxe would be a candidate for purchase.', '...carefree, sweet and free!\nLike summer 99 - Paradoxe smells young and cheerful without being childish.\nWhite creamy blossoms with a citrusy freshness are the prelude, one immediately thinks of a warm summer breeze full of spices. The air is hot and shimmering.\nOrange blossom takes vanilla by the hand and makes a silk bed in the cornfield, feeling good without getting tired.\nThis fragrance puts you in a good mood, lasts like a bomb, has a delicate floral sillage and gives you that certain something, like a thin summer dress that caresses me in the August wind.', ""it's the same with prada paradoxe.\n\nit has a similar dna as many many other perfumes, but honestly iss the hammer.\nsame and yet so wonderfully different.\n\nif i'm honest, i love this perfume. it's the only sweet perfume that i'm allowed to wear without my mother beating me to the ground because of its obtrusiveness.\nif i'm honest, i just can't understand the hate for this. it smells good and belongs to the mainstream, probably that's what bothers the fine baccarat rouge idolizing perfume critics nose of some users here probably.\n\nit's inexplicable, but the scent just smells like sexiness to me. like emily strawberry when she's out of puberty lol. well, definitely fitting for this target group (to which i count myself as an almost twenty year old)\n\nas a not-so-long former smoker, i must also admit that the perfume mixes well with cigarette scent. i can't explain it exactly, but it's just really really delicious.\n\nwhat exactly is paradoxical about it? well, no idea, I'm still trying to figure out.\nprobably the fact that the scent is so incredibly horny and cheap at the same time.\nand I do not mean cheap in the sense of money.\n\nit is simply a perfume that balances on the thin line between sexiness and trashiness on high heels, but that's what makes it. on such I stand now times with perfumes, my friend thank god also.\n\nin any case, the perfume is definitely a compliment catcher and perfect for going out."", 'I love this fragrance.

That's what happened to me with THD Eau Givree. My father had ordered the fragrance as a blind buy and couldn't really do anything with it. He then gave it to me so that I could sell it on. It sat around for a few weeks until I actually had it in my hand and wanted to take the pictures for the souk. Only then did I test it out. I could never do anything with either of the other two THD versions; for me, both fragrances have an earthy note that I don't like at all. After spraying on the Eau Givree, I was more than surprised. The earthy notes are not part of this fragrance, and in general there is hardly any similarity to the other two versions. After seeing the pyramid, I quickly realized that I would keep the fragrance myself.\n\nThis flanker is an insane fragrance from spring to fall, much more invigorating and fresher than the original.\nThey stayed true to themselves with the pepper, which I would consider very similar to the EDT version, only here they used significantly more.\nThe Eau Givree starts with a very intense lemon citrus, juicy, slightly tart and reminiscent of fruit pulp. Somewhat cool and almost so intensely citrusy that it could also be reminiscent of a grapefruit, for me it also has a certain similarity to lemonade. After the first few minutes, however, you can clearly recognize the lemon, which also has a somewhat tingling effect. I can also detect juniper, but at the beginning it is clearly in the background of the lemon and pepper. I already like this combination of notes in other fragrances, and smelling it on its own is also very much to my taste. As the fragrance progresses, it becomes more bitter and slightly dark green and spicy due to the juniper. The lemon remains recognizable until the base.\n\nIn my opinion, it is only slightly similar to Isola Blu PARFUM in terms of the pepper and juniper. The citrus in the Roja fragrance cannot be compared with this one, not that one of the two is better, it's just not similar for me. Since I recognize other notes such as thyme, some lavender, champaca and oakmoss in the Isola blue, the two are slightly similar for me, but still different enough to have both in the collection.\n\nA fragrance in the simple and good category. While other fragrances only depict their top notes, Hermes manages to dedicate an entire fragrance to them, which is why the progression is very linear. Sometimes that's just enough. I don't need to say any more, it's relatively easy to assess whether you should try it. If you like the notes, then go ahead and test it."", ""I came across this beautiful fragrance rather by chance when a good friend bought a bottle and he was so enthusiastic about it that I was allowed to fill 10ml to test it myself, because he said... i know you, you'll like it.\n\nI tested it for the first time on a wonderfully warm but not too hot summer's day in August.\nShowered in the morning, got ready for the day, sprayed it on (a brave 4 -5 sprays on the neck and nape, without knowing how it would perform)\n\nand my first thought was..... WOW, am I in a lemon garden on Lake Garda or on a walk in Sicily, the land of lemons.\nThis wonderfully citrusy freshness that immediately casts a spell over you and makes you dream of a vacation in Sicily It is never too intrusive, but still present.\nIn the drydown, you get the juniper berry in the background and it becomes a little spicier for me.\nThe longevity is perfectly fine for a citrusy and fresh fragrance.\nA fragrance that can be worn from spring to late summer and in my opinion it belongs there, hence the title, SUMMER IN THE FLACON\n\nI can recommend it without reservation and I advise everyone to try it!"", ""Many thanks to Carsten for the bottling of Terre d'Hermès Eau Givrée :-) I have to say that this is a very simple fragrance that can be described as a lemon bomber. I like the scent very much, my best friend found it rather solid and my mother quite bad. That's how opinions differ. Unfortunately, it only lasts around 5 to 6 hours on my skin and the sillage is similarly subdued.\n\nI don't even need to come up with top, heart and base notes here, as there are really only 2 aromas that stand out. Logically, there is the lemon, which is as intense as lemon juice and lemon peel cannot naturally achieve. It smells incredibly intense, fresh but also somewhat synthetic. Some citrus cleansers even come to mind, although the Terre d'Hermès Eau Givrée smells good in this respect. Apart from that, there are also juniper berries that remind me of gin.\n\nThis is a really nice, fresh and citrusy summer fragrance. However, I have to ask myself whether it's worth buying a bottle of it. In my experience, you don't really stand out with it, but it shouldn't bother anyone either."", ""what a beautiful new discovery...i came across the scent by chance and tested it immediately and bought it soon after. wow...what a beautiful, citrusy freshness. extremely long-lasting on me. i'm curious to see how it comes on in summer. kind of reminds me of the louis vuitton fragrances, afternoon swim, imagination etc...! price/performance is certainly better here though ;-) unfortunately my wife doesn't like it at all, so it's probably a polarizing fragrance...but for me it was love at first spray....the top note is bombastic! so my absolute test recommendation for fresh summer fragrances!"", 'The departure is a cool blend of sulfur, juniper, pepper and mineral citrus; like Terre meets Pamplelune on the rocks, but once that exquisite tang fades out the rest is not so impressive.\n\nIt develops a sticky side - like a Jardins’ drydown, then moves through a long period of viscid freshness; until finally, a woody-aromatic vetiver appears in the base.\n\nThe opening is the best grapefruit ever, but the longevity given by the musky ‘citrus’ is just marking time in my opinion. Personally, I would have preferred something more like an Eau de Cologne that fades cleanly - so you can respray and enjoy the bracing head notes, but ‘never mind the quality, feel the width’ is the rule these days.\n\nBeing a flanker in the style of the Jardin series, this doesn’t say anything new; except Nagel’s new style may be morphing into a flanker of Ellena’s old one.', '…with an added grapefruit/citrus RUSH. It’s a very realistic feeling too (to me at least). A juicy, sharp, ice cold grapefruit that you can FEEL. Seriously. I could FEEL the white rind (the part in between the peel and the fruit).

However, you would expect this from the price, because it is quite something. You have to put a few green bills on the table for this fragrance. It is supposed to be special, almost complex. But is it really?\n\nFirst things first: the fragrance is wonderfully creamy, cuddly, with a hint of ""sweet darkness"" tonka bean, which sinks deeply sensual into a warm sea of jasmine, while gentle cinnamon flakes and rich fruity notes melt into the whole, as if they were just waiting to combine with other components. A crystal-clear wind blows, which only brings a few icicles and creaky spices with it over time. A muffled depth full of tobacco and warm accents soon opens up. Here the angels sing O thou dark one, instead of O thou merry one. Snowflakes drift in your mind, it crackles in the fireplace. Tobacco becomes much stronger over time and has a beautiful relationship with jasmine. Tonka bean is always emphasized, which produces one of the most beautiful sweet scents I have ever smelled. You sink into the fragrance as if it were made of fluffy black clouds. Rounded off with a hint of high-quality alcohol & some tuberose, which is really velvety here and in no way shrill, as is so often the case.\n\nA very fine specimen, but for a few euros less, it would be absolutely passable in all respects! The price is not justified. Other houses can also do this well, but for much less. I now have it at home as a sharing bottle and that\'s ok, but paying for the fragrance alone is quite a hole in the budget. So be it! If it hits you in the heart, you\'ll get it, but it\'s not enough for the 10 for me. It\'s a beauty, perfect for winter, with a subtle, sinister and absolutely brilliant sweet touch, but in my eyes there\'s more to it!\n\nDurability and sillage are in the upper range, not to mention the bottle.\nBeautiful deep dark black, with red/gold accents. Heavy in the hand.\nAlso looks good on the shelf.', 'Hello everyone,\n\ni have unbelievably thought for a very long time about whether I should write a review (at all).\n\nOf course it\'s about the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" !\nBefore I come to the ("") most important things, which will probably interest most people, I would like to say something about the bottle, the sprayer, the lid and the box! You can think what you want about the company (as with everyone), but you have to admit one thing - the bottles (with the lid) are an eye-catcher and as far as this point is concerned I can only give them a true (!) 10 out of 10. I really can\'t help anyone who gives this an 8 or lower. We are noticeably and visibly in the absolute high-end range here...\n\nBut now...\n\nOverrated?\n\nYes, yes - the video by Marc Eggers and Marc Gebauer have already decently boosted the hype!\n\nDo you need it?\n\nWe are talking about the high-end niche sector in general and the wheel was not reinvented with this fragrance and you can clearly recognize the signature here in my opinion + there are certain parallels to other fragrances in this respect (more on this later). ALSO... - not mandatory, certainly not, but you should know it (my opinion) !\n\nAre you worth it?\n\nIt really is a tiresome topic, because on the one hand -\n\nnow to the point about the ""dear price"", I\'ll put it this way if we say we have a certain desire for luxury products / fragrance products in the niche sector then I find it difficult or quite honestly almost pointless to chalk this up as something negative. Nobody is forcing us to spend this money. If you ask me now: Benny is it worth it? Then I say, if you want to spend it, test it and then buy it, but I recommend everyone to test it! You just have to experience it - the art of what is / can be possible.\n\nAnd on the other hand -\n\nwe are here in the range of 10€ per ml (depending on the offer or sometimes even more), so in my opinion it is already relatively normal to ask yourself - cost - benefit factor, is it for example 9x better than a designer fragrance and can you still recommend something like this with a clear conscience...?\nI find this very difficult...!\nWhat does it smell like?\n\nFragrances by Clive are usually very complex with great development and co. but this one is a little different. For the first 15 seconds, you get everything that characterizes the fragrance AND it\'s also very linear. Yes, 1, 2 things become more or less, that\'s normal - my opinion!\nSee fragrance notes (above) and except for the jasmine (fortunately not too noticeable) I notice all of them, but very prominent are the tonka bean, tobacco and amber. This is a really very difficult combination that can very quickly lead to headaches or nausea (if the composition is wrong), but the implementation here is very good and I really like it!\nSimilarity to: There is the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" always some moments where it reminds me of well-known fragrances - ""XJ 1861 Naxos | XerJoff"" (tobacco, tonka bean, jasmine) , Herod (smoky - sweet + the characteristic less sillage and good performance = after 4h skin scent), some Carlisle (this dark - smoky and sweet) , the Amber Star from the grooooben fragrance direction ( max. 10%) and the magical + mystical and the style and fine tuning of the ""AddictiveArts - Jump Up and Kiss Me Hedonistic | Clive Christian"" !\nHow is it received?\n\nLike my two (2017\'s) Herod + Carlisle very well..., sometimes even my wife wishes I would NOT (!) use it because it goes down so well with the opposite sex.\n\nPerformance:\n\nThe better I think is fair... and you can boost it excellently in terms of performance with, for example, Molecule 01, Herod ..., but now my absolute SECRET, take 4x the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" and 3x the ""AddictiveArts - Jump Up and Kiss Me Hedonistic | Clive Christian"" my favorite combination since mid-October.\n\nIf I wasn\'t really convinced, I wouldn\'t recommend it to you! (You can test it once, but buy a bottle.... - if you like it like me then yes)\n\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', ""Whether the thing is worth 550 euros or not, everyone can judge for themselves. I think it is, because I haven't smelled anything like it before and no other fragrance has ever inspired me so much.\n\nThere was a gale-force headwind from all directions because Marc Gebauer presented it in his YouTube room and all perfume connoisseurs naturally wanted to shoot against it. It's partly understandable - because everyone wants to justify through precise research and years of experience why this or that, which the niche-affine general public likes, is actually not that great...and whether the ingredients justify the luxury price? Logical! Just like you can buy anoraks for 1500 euros. All justified by the quality.\nIf anyone has a perfectly fitting alternative for a smaller price, please let me know anyway ;)\n\nThe only thing I can say about the fragrance is that it makes me stop constantly as I walk straight ahead to let the cloud of scent pass me by, which I then inhale with relish. Alternatively, my wrist wanders towards nostril 1 and 2 every minute.\nI could wear Blonde Amber all the time, even if it tends to be more of a cooler season and evening scent. There are insanely strong, image-generating reviews of the fragrance's progression, pyramid, etc. here, to which I can only refer.\n\nAnyway, I have the third bottling of the fragrance and I have to promise myself that it was the last. I have to get the bottle so that I have peace. At least for now, until the bottom of the bottle separates us."", 'First of all, I would like to ask you not to drive me through the village if I do not completely celebrate ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" and also take a critical look at the composition here and there. Nevertheless - for the record - this is a good fragrance.\n\nIn my eyes, it would be an even better fragrance if it could maintain the magic of the opening. Here I can only say, WOW, a 10/10. This really does pass for an aphrodisiac. It smells like I\'m popping 5 fruit gums in my mouth at once, a real explosion! Floral, fruity, sweet, seductive, erotic - simply amazing!\n\nUnfortunately, Blonde Amber cannot maintain this magic in my eyes. Because after only about 5 minutes, the tobacco noticeably asserts itself. Many people celebrate this and I can understand why. The tobacco gives the fragrance corners and edges, a certain wickedness and yes, also character. In my eyes, however, it takes away this ""light"" and erotically seductive quality. Don\'t get me wrong, the fragrance remains interesting, it\'s just that I find the characteristic develops a bit pungent in my nose. I think it\'s a shame that it loses its lightness and that ""special something"" of its opening. It develops more arbitrarily for me. Yes, the fruits remain and so does the sweetness, but they scream more for attention, according to the motto: ""here I am, notice me"". The fragrance reveals its intention and thus loses its mystique. That\'s cool in the club! You\'re sure to stand out there and if you\'ve decided to spend the night in other people\'s beds, you might even manage it.\n\nPersonally, I miss the elegance, the style, that something less ""obvious"". So I think you definitely have to be the type of man/woman for this fragrance. For me, this is an extroverted fragrance that doesn\'t hold back, that is loud and reveals its intention. If you can identify with this fragrance characteristic, go for it! The fragrance will not disappoint, even for the price. For everyone else who is a little more reserved, who is looking for something that smells seductive but is less offensive, yes, I would advise against this fragrance.\n\nSomehow this may sound contradictory, but I\'ll summarize it again in a nutshell. The fragrance DNA is great, it has rough edges, captivates with ambery notes, a seductive sweetness and a smoky, noble tobacco. For me personally, however, it is too ""puffy"", too deliberate. But maybe I\'m just not the type for such a loud fragrance. For the price, however, I would have hoped for that ""certain something"" more.\n\nPS: I might buy a bottle and spray it on in the club. As mentioned above, I think it works best there.', 'This perfume is just rightly experiencing hype in the niche world.\n\nMy personal association with this incredible perfume is a well-dressed gentleman. Suit by Tom Ford and the Blonde Amber as a good smelling companion.\nWho comes to mind, James Bond in the movie Skyfall, place Shanghai.\n\nThere are countless amber fragrances, but this one has the crown on not without reason.', 'I am now testing the fragrance as I have ordered a leftover bottle.

For me, perfection as far as a great warming autumn scent is concerned. It's just so cozy and I still love it today. Also the durability is really satisfying. From the performance you do not need an extrait. Many laymen think such flankers and in this case the extrait version is just more performance. This is often not the case, as there are already differences in fragrances. This fragrance is also somewhat different from its original, but this great basic DNA is always perceptible.\nWho knows the original can order this fragrance without risk blind. The RRP is a little too high with 245€, but you get it already significantly cheaper. Described in a nutshell, one can summarize: Initially stronger sillage, darker fragrance DNA, possibly also a bit more masculine than the soft original. I like darker versions of lighter fragrances, as is also the case with Prada L'Homme and Prada L'Homme Intense. Especially in the dark such fragrances come very well, have something mysterious.\n\nThe packaging is great. Matching the dark fragrance DNA this comes in great black cardboard where all fragrance notes are listed again. This brand has style. Also the uniform flacons can convince and these atomizers are already world class.\nWhen dividing the strength of the notes was played around a bit: The cardamom note in the opening is much much stronger than that in the EdP, but the fig note is very dimmed down and the black tea is also slightly weaker. Here, especially the cardamom fans get their money's worth. The top note is extremely long present and the heart note goes down slightly, which is not too bad. The 5 base notes, on the other hand, are very present and the dark patchouli kicks in very early and provides a slightly darker DNA. The sweetness from the tonka and bourbon vanilla is not sticky and provides a soft and sweet vibe in the background. Also this beautiful sandalwood note is very pleasant as in the original and is for me in combination with the other notes already perfection. The fragrance is already very cuddly, cuddly and simply also very interesting and balanced.\nThe performance is slightly better than the original. Especially the opening is already beastmode. The Extrait is already a perfect fragrance for evening. Intense and also the fragrance aura is very appealing for the late hours of the day. Sillage is the first 2-3 hours very room-filling, then becomes very pleasant.\n\nOn the whole for me a draw between the EdP and the Extrait. Both have their advantages and I like to have both in my collection. Who has not so much or wants to spend: Lattafa has with Liam a clone, which I will also still test. Overall a great extrait, which is simply worth the price. Especially for men and ladies who like dark fragrances a great upgrade."", '06. February 2023, a normal day at the office so far. It\'s quite cold outside and I\'m the last to leave.\nI get into the car and realize that something is wrong with my right eye. It no longer closes when I blink. My girlfriend is studying medicine, so I sent her a short recording of it. Alarm! Off to the hospital. This could be a sign of a stroke. After hours of waiting, the examination and the result. Peripheral facial nerve palsy.\n\nI had to stay there overnight and undergo a lumbar puncture the next day. I\'d better not go into what that means here.\n\nWhen I got up in hospital the next morning, I couldn\'t believe it: the non-functioning closure of the eyelid when I blinked turned into complete paralysis of the right side of my face. Mouth, nose, eyes, forehead. I simply couldn\'t move anything, what a feeling!\n\nBy this time, I was totally in a perfume flash. Thank goodness I was well looked after at home by my girlfriend & browsed through all the possible sharing\'s here on Parfumo every day.\n\nAmong other things, I had ordered 10ml of Gris Charnel EXTRAIT and the fragrance finally arrived. I carefully sprayed it on my forearm and smelled it directly, at least with one nostril. This moment will never be lost to me again.\n\nI couldn\'t describe it, but this fragrance hit my synapses so hard that I immediately felt a sense of hope and strength. I called my girlfriend and told her to smell it too. For her it was just a ""yeah, it smells okay"". Please what? Like just ""okay?"" That\'s the scent!!!\n\nOver this long period, more and more bottlings and samples arrived. I tried everything each time, full of anticipation, but none of them were like this perfume for me at the time.\n\nEvery morning after my ""facial training"", I went to my little bottling rack, picked up this atomizer and smelled it. Each time, I was overcome with a kind of warmth and serenity.\n\nThe soft fig, together with that teen note and the slightly spicy punch just completely hit me. It\'s still one of my favorite fragrances & I wonder why I don\'t have a bottle yet. The last remnants of the bottling are being treasured like a baby.\n\nPS: The bottling is now empty & I treated myself to a bottle :)', 'At first I just wanted to write a short statement, until I realized that the words available to me were not enough. It would certainly have made sense to sit down for 15 minutes and think about how I could summarize what I wanted to say in short words. But then I sniffed my arm again.\n\nThis fragrance deserves a few more words.\n\nBy the way, Gris Charnel means, as far as I can tell, figuratively ""the sensuality of gray"". ""Gris"" is gray and ""Charnel"" can also be translated as physical and carnal in addition to sensual. And when I think about it, that fits quite well. A gray embodiment in the form of the bottle, with an inner sensuality.\n\nI get the same impression when I apply Gris Charnel EXTRAIT. It is only wonderful for a short time at first. Really only the first few seconds, when the veil of fragrance rises briefly from the skin after application and gives you a little foretaste. A taste of its true potential. Of the depth it actually possesses.\n\nAnd then...\n\nHe is gone. Suddenly. The wonderful scent of soft, almost powdery, slightly fruity, creamy and green freshness is gone.\n\nI then notice something that I can\'t understand. It smells herbaceous. Smoky. Green. I searched for it a few times in the other reviews to be able to understand it. This spicy note must be the vetiver. Plus the teen notes on top?\nI have no idea what it is. But what I smell is really unexpected and almost magical. And it also makes me sad. How can such a wonderful fragrance turn into this spice monster in a matter of seconds?\n\nAt this point, I kept smelling my arm and trying to waft the scent up my nose. To no avail. The smell remained. Too bad, I thought. So a short statement.\n\nNo sooner said than done. Sat down, opened Parfumo, Gris Charnel Extrait, statement. What can I say, ah, good at first, then smoky, strange, not my cup of tea.\nAnd here... we\'re back to the beginning of this review.\n\nI smelled my arm again to be able to describe it better.\n\nThen I thought for a moment that I had gone mad and could conjure up Gris Charnel Extrait. Where has the smoky, spicy scent just gone? It can\'t have been more than 30 minutes ago that I noticed this change in the smokiness on my arm. How can it be gone now, almost as quickly as it came?\n\nWhat I smelled then reminded me again of that first breeze that came into my nose from the scent. But somehow more mature now. More grown up. More serious. But also deeper and ultimately more sensual.\n\nNow I\'m sitting here smelling my arm again. But not because I don\'t want to admit it, like when I turned into the spice monster.\n\nBut because I can\'t believe how good it smells.\n\nI can\'t say anything about longevity and sillage, I\'ll leave that to others.\n\nBut so much for my feelings and the magical transformation of the fragrance. For me, it is pure art and what I enjoy about fragrances. Complexity and transformation.\n\nIt\'s gris outside, by the way. But what I smell on my arm is indescribably Charnel.', ""I had the opportunity to test this fragrance I was so excited it was one of the most beautiful moments for me at the beginning something smoky but after a while the scent develops so beautifully, black tea vanilla a scent that I can not really describe it has something sweet and at the same time something smoky. So at the moment it's really my favorite"", 'It was in the spring of this year when I was allowed to smell this fragrance for the first time. Through quite a few recommendations and reviews that have highly praised the fragrance, my expectations rose exponentially with. Arriving in Berlin to visit my sister as well as other friends, I ended up in KaDeWe one day. An attentive and friendly employee introduced me to new perfume releases. When she held the bottle of ""Gris Charnel Extrait"" in front of my nose, I had to smile.\n\nI knew at the same moment, when the fragrance molecules of the Extrait\'s have been captured by my sense of smell, which fragrance I will already wear in the fall. Most of all, I would not have wanted to wait. The Gris Charnel Extrait gives me a similar feel-good effect as the Dior Homme Parfum, but the tonka bean and bourbon vanilla give the fragrance a sweet ravishing depth. While creations such as Wūlóng Chá EXTRAIT DE PARFUM project a fresh note of tea and fig, the black tea and fig appear in the Gris Charnel Extrait, in creamy symbiosis.\n\nThe durability is excellent, so that after the morning application to skin and clothing, I could still register the Extrait until late in the evening. The sillage is good and in my opinion tuned to perfection, as the fragrance follows the wearer rather than leaving traces in the wind.', 'The Gris Charnel EXTRAIT has been massively hyped over the last few months, and not without reason; the scent has a really unique and beautiful fragrance DNA that is close to a chai latte.

It's been on my wish list for a long time. Alongside Rehab and Musk Therapy, I now have the complete white line in my collection. Each of these series is worthwhile. Musk Therapy is a bit different, Rehab and Paragon go in a similar direction.\nI love white fragrances. Clean, neat fragrances that do justice to this radiant white bottle. Initio creates this twist of cleanliness and sex appeal with this white line. Simply one of my favorite brands in the niche with which you can't go wrong in my opinion and blindbuys are not as dangerous as some other brands. Just extremely pleasing without being too 0815.\n\nParagon was only moderately successful at first. At least in contrast to the other Initios. It still hovers somewhat under the radar, but also has some fans. You should always form your own opinion as tastes differ. I think this Paragon is simply brilliant, similar to the Rehab. Roughly speaking, these two go in a similar direction.\nIt's definitely worth the money if you look for a good price on the internet. It's also worth the RRP of €250, but you can get it for less than €180. The packaging and the bottle are quite something and you get nice clean vibes with seductive accents on high quality.\n\nAs I said, this Paragon goes roughly in this Rehab direction. If you liked the Rehab, you should definitely try this one. It is by no means a twin, but this clean DNA with this seductive sweetness is also very present. The two also share this beautiful lavender opening. Sage and plum have also been added, which already has a very unique touch and stands out from the mainstream. The fragrance is never too heavy despite this pyramid. On the contrary: this sage-lavender freshness is convincing and is accompanied by plum and a pleasant sweet-woody note. Sandalwood is added in the base, which is already very present in the drydown. I hardly notice any or almost no oud, which doesn't bother me. All in all, a fragrance that convinces me 100% and is simply totally interesting and unique. It's already a new love for me. There are also plenty of ways to wear it. Almost always: all year round and for all occasions. Also 100% unisex for me, similar to the Rehab.\nPerformance is outstanding for a fresher, cleaner fragrance. Double digits with a pleasant and good sillage. Perfect and satisfying.\n\nAll in all, a perfect purchase for me that I will enjoy and would buy again. It's definitely worth a test."", ""Bergamot/lavender in the head ... it's wonderful how the fragrance then picks up the support of PaloSanto and black pepper, carried by the sweetness of plum - and then the so-called healing oils of sandalwood and oud. I currently know of no better perfume for dealing with trauma! It's amazing how the limbic system reacts, how this fragrance is able to provide calm as well as stimulation. My new favorite fragrance!"", ""To the Paragon has already been said a lot. For my understanding, I would also need to say nothing more, because only when you read the great reviews of the Parfumos here, you can start to understand this fragrance.\nNamely, that this fragrance can not be comprehended.\nI feel an admiration when I read here how strongly different and especially things, how many, sometimes absolutely mutual, notes are smelled in this fragrance.\nBut I want to put my opinion to appreciate this fragrance because I got to know him through a small tester. After that, I got me at least 3 fillings of 10 ml each, to buy in the end but still the bottle.\nThe Paragon is actually the first fragrance that I bought after the many testing as a flacon. I love him...\n\nThe fragrance started for me fruity-creamy, which fruit does not open up to me. A particular note I can not smell out, a lavender hint I receive through my nose. Yes, lavender is listed here, in fact I know only since then that I like lavender in fragrances. I have this fragrance to thank for this discovery. But do not worry for lavender muffle: I mean, hardly anyone smells this note out but this creaminess is already only for those who like it creamed.\n\nI also do not like oud fragrances so much: the more I was shocked that oud is listed here. I absolutely do not perceive him. For this the sandalwood base, which dances and creams on my skin on and on for a very long time.... I wouldn't describe it with Nivea or Body Lotion vibes, the fruitiness is very present for that and not soapy enough at all. No, for me it does not smell like a creamy body lotion, its creaminess is unique and unique for me...\n\nThe scent is rather quiet and mysterious, yet decidedly present and not at the same time.... He blows himself even me over the nose if he has any desire at all, as if he had a life and will of his own. and that 3 days later still.... To at least with me the durability is unbeatable for such a quiet fragrance.\n\nVery elegant and noble, my husband likes the fragrance, by the way, also like, and that wants already, with his difficult attitude to niches and their prices, what is called.\n\nThis fragrance does not want to please but challenge. I see him to a self-confident woman who knows how to dress and move and no longer feels the need to be pigeonholed by social constraints. A woman, therefore, who has chosen inner freedom as a way of life.\n\nNo blind purchase candidate but definitely worth a tester. Maybe discovers the one or the other here, accompanied by the Paragon, also his way to freedom\n\nBest regards\nChristianne"", 'First of all, I bought the Paragon blind.\n\nWhen he perceived the fragrance the first time at the spray head I knew immediately that I will like it and exactly that was confirmed after the first time on the skin test also.\n\nThe fragrance is wonderfully light and smells 1to1 like my body lotion only just with a shot of plum.\n\nMentally, he has somehow moved me as the very first to a warm summer evening at the lake with a glass of wine to it.\n\nThe fragrance is quite present, however, it would surprise me if someone perceives this as disturbing, because the fragrance smells like a body lotion as described at the beginning.\n\nThe durability has my expectations with 7-8 hours on my skin also really excited.\n\nTime of day and occasion are to wear this fragrance really completely indifferent.\n\nConclusion: A really successful fragrance that always goes for my sensation!', ""Initio is a familiar number to everyone in the fragrance world, but the Paragon is somehow lost in Initio. Is it really much worse than Oud for Greatness , Side Effect , Rehab or Musk Therapy ? Nah, absolutely not, at least from my point of view! The newcomer to the house, however, has somehow just not yet found the connection and hype experienced, but that's not too bad.\n\nLet's skip to the fragrance:\n\n- It's a fresh-fruity-tart plum-sage scent that's so special, it's hard to describe simply. Although it is fresh-fruity-tart, it is also sweet. Really very special!\n\n- In the prelude, a plum-sage combination is immediately perceptible, which lasts through the entire course of the fragrance and goes with it into the drydown. Together with the lavender, the fragrance acts at the beginning still fresh, but becomes increasingly sweet in the Drydown!\n\n- After that, the fragrance goes into an oud-sandalwood base, although it must be mentioned that absolutely no animalic oud is present, rather a slightly sweet oud, which makes the fragrance become increasingly sweet in the drydown, but still retains the relaxing sage-plum combo.\n\n- Durability is really surprisingly good, the sillage upper midfield; but surprisingly good performance, especially in the first hour the fragrance radiates really well\n\nA real hidden champion, but definitely needs to be tested, especially since the sage-plum combo is not the typical combo and also the playing along of oud in the combo is not always a guarantee for a crowd pleaser.\n\nDefinitely worth the try!"", 'Initio has dedicated a small series of fragrances to hedonism - or hedonists: Musk Therapy, Rehab and Paragon.

The characterization ""Noir"" probably refers to the thoughts one makes when they smell it around them, a highly erotic, highly addictive fragrance.\n\nThe musk note, like in all For Her perfumes I have tried, is almost animalic, it\'s soft and powdery, and creamy, but also kinda ""dirty"", but not in a bad way, but in a hot way.', ""I already have several fragrances from Narciso but this is my favorite.

Warm,..."", 'Nice enough, but neither here nor there. The tuberose can be a bit bubble-gummy at times, but not grossly. Smells like it could be your friend’s mom or something. Mostly floral and musk with a very vanilla base. Almost like a shea butter body cream kind of vibe.\n\nBetween this flanker and the original Musc Noir, I think the latter is prettier to me.']"

Whether your wearing sweats & a t-shirt going to the store or if you in a button down suit ready for a celebration, this is a scent you can go to. And I do mean easily, it's taken the original code & made it modern. It gave it a slightly sweeter side with the Brazilian Tonka bean on the dry down but the cedar will smooth that out into just an incredible smell through and through. Not to mention, MAD COMPLIMENTS! Women absolutely love this fragrance!\nSo like it or hate the powdery smooth, this is the James Bond of Armani.....a smooth, modest gentleman"", '… but it isn’t bad at all.\n\nPeople are hating on it because it isn’t “groundbreaking” but what IS nowadays? It is a FLANKER, not a debut scent. It wasn’t claiming to be anything “different”. It is very similar to the OG, but it’s got it’s own personality. I love the drydown.\n\nIt’s also being called “weak” and being knocked down for “poor performance” but I get a projection bubble of about 2-3ft with a sillage that LINGERS nicely, and leads the noses directly to the wearer, and the longevity is a nice 6-8+ hours easily.\n\nAgain, if you want something “revolutionary” or “innovating” it isn’t going to be what you’re asking, but it by no means is a “soft” as people have been saying, nor does it “die off” as quickly.\n\nIs it worth $160 for 125ml? That’s the question. For me, I’m not completely disappointed I shelled out that much money, but some people would be. Don’t blind buy it, but also, don’t ignore it. Give it a shot the next time you’re in Dillards or Macys.', 'It is sweet and powdery enough for dates and cooler months, yet fresh and soapy enough for work and warmer weather. At times I get whiffs of something reminiscent of a blue fragrance and other times I detect wafts of a distinct iris note à la Dior Homme. Overall, it is an alluring scent.\n\nWhile not a fragrance that shouts from the rooftops, Code Parfum consistently reminds you of its confident but unobtrusive presence. It lasts at least eight hours on me and I spray only half as much as I do with other fragrances to achieve the same potency. I think this unassuming all-purpose expertly-crafted Code has been overlooked and maligned by those expecting it to be a loud heavy powerhouse.', 'This is a great flanker, more mature and not as sweet as most of the other Codes. Iris is the new fad, so this is Armani’s intro to it. This is a great all around scent and can be a signature scent as well. Great performance, but not a beast and that’s a good thing. I’ve been wearing Code since it came out. My favorites are EDP, Absolu and now I’ve added Parfum to the list. I can say almost anytime I wear any of the aforementioned I get complements. Blind buy if you want a little more mature option for your Code collection. Also love the new bottle, (magnetic) the older Oval caps we a nuisance.', 'Sometimes, you do not change the winning team - it is a saying.\nI guess, YSL with LNDL, Armani with ADG and also with code, are in the same category if you ask me.\n\nThe Code EDP was really nice and powerful, strong and pleasant but too much deviating from the original DNA in order to be considered a proper ""code"" flanker. The same could be said about Absolu, Absolu GOLD etc ...\n\nNow, probably the Armani product team thought .. how to cash the ""code"" cow some more, but with the hardcore fans (like me) which liked a lot the OG EDT but now think it is simply too weak to be worth considering when purchasing a new scent.\n\nThe PARFUM, released last week is for me an evolution and not a revolution for what regards the scent DNA, it has a bit of added sweetness and the manly notes like tobacco and leather taken out (not that in the EDT are very present, just saying).\n\nI do enjoy this new release which has a decent sillage and also will last a few hours on the skin, taking into consideration that most likely this batch is very fresh and has not matured so much, I do expect it to perform better in the weeks to come.\n\nNot groundbreaking, but also not a bad release .. it could be worse.', ""I tried Armani Code Parfum twice on my boyfriend and loved it. This sweet, fresh note is special in its own way. You can wear it especially well in everyday life, whether for sports or at school. Can also be worn on light dates.

Slightly fruity and tinglingly sweet and spicy. Shortly afterwards, the suede hits and lingers for a long time. A dark, authentic leather that I like better than Tuscan or Ombre leather. Less scratchy and penetrating, but wonderfully soft and much gentler. The incense immediately follows. It becomes darker and darker, spicier, more masculine, but never oppressive or intrusive. After around 4 hours, it becomes softer and softer; the vanilla slowly emerges and pushes the leather-incense mix into the background.\n\nThe fragrance is complex, but never wants to take center stage. Mysterious, spicy, deep. A real everyday all-rounder with that certain something for men.\n\nIf you like Ombre Nomade, Tuscan leather or widian London, but don't fancy a fragrance that polarizes and has to fill an entire room, this is the perfect fragrance for you\nExtremely successful all round."", 'How to start. I have been dealing with fragrances for a long time. Leathery scents are among my favorites and therefore I am always looking for new treasures.\nWhich I always liked, but the price was often too much for me: Widian London. The probably next to Tuscan Leather best-known leather fragrance.\nYou can say all 3 scents go in the same direction.\nBut now comes the but: The Kinetic Sillage makes some different. You smell the DNA and you also notice the leather. But it is not really in the foreground. For me, the raspberry and creamy notes dominate. The fragrance is so beautifully soft and creamy and super to wear in everyday life. But also has that certain extra to wear it as a special fragrance for great occasions.\n\nFor me, it takes the notes from the London and reinforces those that are easy to like and those that are not easy to like move into the background.\n\nSillage and durability are very similar to the London. Who is looking for something very unusual and extravagant should rather reach for the London.\nI, however, wanted a fragrance that brings compliments, is easy to like and where the P / L ratio fits.\nThat is the case here! For the price on 100ml he hangs for me the London and the TL by lengths.\nThe bottle is noble and feels very high quality.\nAnd he comes for me from one of the best perfumers in the world. Many great works come from his hand so also this.\nSo who likes leather and fruity notes, please test this fragrance!', ""Widian London has rightly joined the bestseller list of niche perfumes, as its leather-raspberry combo is simply irresistibly fine/beautiful, yes, finer than Tuscan Leather!\nAfter a while, there were more and more discussions about possible weaker batches, or fruity/leathery etc... You might think that the London has changed or been changed over time, I can't say whether that's true or not, but personally the new batches seem a little weaker and leatherier to me than the older ones. And that's exactly what I miss, that beautiful, fruity raspberry note that set the fragrance apart from the TL and made it more unique/sensual, more refined, because, as already mentioned, the new batches have been toned down in this respect. Nevertheless, I compared both fragrances (Sillage and London) at the same time on the back of my hand and the result was amazing. The price of London is also astonishing at just under 260 euros for 50ml, whereas Sillage costs just 190 euros for 100ml, which is definitely something to consider! First of all, both fragrances smell extremely similar, only the nuances as well as the durability and projection are different\nI won't go into detail about the fragrance, I think that should already be clear and obvious. I will merely point out the differences.\n\nI can't adequately comment on the quality either, as I'm not very familiar with the specific ingredients (apart from oud), but I'll still rate my feelings and the composition!\nFragrance/subtle: To put it succinctly, the sillage is more fruity, less leathery and that's exactly what makes it better/subtler/sensual, more beautiful and more pleasant for me! In plain language: Sillage is fruitier due to the more present raspberry!\nLongevity and projection: An important characteristic of a perfume, especially in this price range, but it must also be specifically mentioned here that especially the durability and projection is different for each skin and factors such as temperature, weather, daily form etc. are relevant to be able to judge at all, so I refer this to my own personal experience! Sillage surprised me, as this fragrance was always longer and more intense than London. Where London was almost gone, I could still hear the sillage, especially the raspberry-vanilla note, it was melting! Do you have an intimate date in the evening? Then spray it on in the morning and in the evening you have an extra booster for the pleasure of two - basically! Specifically: Sillage radiates longer and stronger than London! Both lasted more than 10 hours, yet sillage with much stronger projection from 3 hours onwards!\n\nConclusion: Why the hell should I spend almost 260 euros for 50ml when I have a fragrance for 190 euros 100ml that is far better for me! The only argument would be a nicer box, nicer/better bottle and more leathery character - not mine!\n\nPS: The sillage is almost 1 to 1 with the older batches from London!\nConclusion: Sillage is one of my favorites, not an Artisan, not a specialty, but it doesn't always have to be! I feel very comfortable with this fragrance and it stays with me all day - that's enough for me.\n\nPS: I deliberately leave out obsolete complimentary arguments because they are pointless and trivial!"", ""Don't get me wrong I love the London and it's rightly at the top of the list of best fragrances but this isn't about it, it's about its little brother if you can call it that!\nThe sillage of Kinetic perfums!\nThese two fragrances could not be more similar and yet they are so different.\nIt's just a little lighter, comes across a little more fruity and seems to me like a version in which everything has been changed that could be disturbing about London!\n\nAfter spraying it on for the first time, you are met with a light leather note that couldn't be more elegant without exception, and then the raspberry joins in, making the whole thing sweeter and fruitier.\nIt is by no means artificial or pungent, but blends in very well.\nThe oud gives the whole thing a certain depth and warmth and makes the whole thing seem continuously special and gives a feeling of luxury.\n\nFor me personally, the better choice for London and a little insider tip! The price is also a real bargain.\nSure, it doesn't come close to the bottle, but that's not the point, I would describe it as solid but by no means special, but the atomizer is absolutely top.\nI smell it all day long and when I put on my coat the next day, I immediately notice this warm and luxurious fragrance.\nIt comes across particularly well on cool and rainy days.\nSo as you have been able to read so far, for me simply a 10/10"", ""I think this fragrance manages to convey exactly what it is trying to say. For me personally, it evokes one thing above all, a nice evening with friends while wearing a leather jacket and the scent of the fruity raspberry cocktail wafting into my nose.\n\nThis fragrance manages to make leather and raspberry dance with each other beautifully. These two notes really stand out, in a positive way. It does for me (I'm sorry for the comparison, because the other work is also great) what the London doesn't do for me. The smell of leather is not overpowering. The fragrance becomes slightly creamier for me over time, which I really like, while the London becomes stronger and stronger in its leather note. This difference is enough for me to indulge in this fragrance. On that note, unpack your leather jackets people! Hasta La Vista!"", ""I went to Brückner in Munich without expecting much. I asked about the sillage, received top advice and was presented with similar fragrances. But let's stay with Kinetic. As soon as I sprayed it on, it was clear -> OK, this is going to be something.

Throughout, it has a citric quality that I cannot categorize in the lemon universe as either lemon zest or lemon juice - possibly something in between. This ""something"" is flattered by the tonka bean, which makes the fragrance a pleasantly warm citrus scent for me!', ""First of all, don't worry, the fragrance won't leave you smelling like an oversweet and walking coke bottle all day!\n\nI have to say that I've already tried a few fragrances by now, of course, I'm certainly not a pro when it comes to sniffing, but I have to say that I've never smelled anything so cool and unique.\n\nWith Tonka Cola everything is just right!

Again and again you can find here quite unusual combinations, mostly underpinned with a typical synthetic, which you can find so in my opinion only at Mancera. My nose smells fragrances of this house quickly out, perhaps also because I like the basic Machart.\n\nWith Tonka Cola was immediately piqued my interest and what can I say, the implementation is quite successful, as long as you only pay attention to the first third of the scent.\n\nThe start is characterized by some citrus, a lot of cinnamon and a clear cola note, very exciting!\nCinnamon you should definitely like, because as we all know, this spice rarely lets loose.

There are very few fragrances in this category, which I like.\n\nHere is aggravated by the fact that the combination of cinnamon and cola with labdanum simply does not harmonize. It makes the fragrance seem much less modern. Without meaning it disrespectfully, I then always have the association towards an older lady.\nThis is per se not equally bad, but can not be reconciled with my preferences.\n\nFor me, the fragrance is not wearable in the long run, it becomes annoying and typical of Mancera is also that it is anything but quiet.

I didn't necessarily expect it to be a fragrance for me. Do I really want to smell like cola? I think cherry is great, but citrus scents are always a bit of a problem for me, just like cinnamon... Hmmm...\nWhen the fragrance arrived, I sprayed it on straight away and was immediately in love with it. I've never smelled anything like it before: definitely cola, but not as blatantly sweet as I had feared, and clearly lemon, just like in Lemon Coke. There's also a little bit of cherry, but it's quite in the background. Nutmeg and cinnamon are not clearly recognizable for me, which is quite good in my case ;-)\nIn the dry down, the fragrance becomes softer and the lemon recedes into the background, where it combines with the vanilla. Tonka comes through very clearly. Surprisingly, this harmonizes perfectly with the cola.\n\nFor me, the fragrance is suitable for all kinds of occasions and at any time of year. In summer, it's better not to overdo it with the dosage, as it could be a little too much. I also wear the fragrance in the office and so far my colleagues have only had positive things to say about it.\n\nA really very special fragrance that not everyone will like.

A mixture of Dr. Pepper, Coca Cola vanilla and the classic cola crackers...."", 'This is my first wearing of Mancera Tonka Cola, a 2022 release that, for me, is fortunately as described, as I enjoy the taste and smell of cola, though it’s proven to be a bit difficult to capture in fragrance, the balance of the citrus and caramel in particular being the most elusive. The fragrance seems to have yielded some mixed responses, which I at least partly...', 'A very citrusy, fizzy cola. I think it has a realistic cola note that lasts for a long time. Maybe not quite 100% like original Coca Cola/Coke, but definitely similar to some brand of cola. Sweet, warm and ambery with an indefinable blend of warm spices. I guess nutmeg and cinnamon describe the spiciness well, even though I have never thought cola as cinnamon-ish. There is...', 'My dearest Mancera, For me, this perfume is like a little trip down memory lane. The first few minutes remind me of Coke lollipops and a carefree time as a teenager. Drinking Coke, going out, having fun, sitting in the skate park until the sun goes down.

It comes across too quickly as a cheap cleaning agent. Here, this assessment was correct again.\n\nNew York is the theme and I think of skyscrapers, busy back alleys, crime scenes, Broadway shows, expensive housing, a whole lot of people, crowded tour buses and mass transit and so much more. And what do I get with this composition? The little kid standing in Central Park for a little while, lost in thought, blowing bubbles until the little can is empty. And I really mean that, because after less than an hour there's nothing left. Nothing at all. And apart from soapy notes in the form of aldehydes, lily of the valley and a few other white flowers, I didn't even notice them at a projection of less than five centimetres. A waxy woody note lingers a little longer, but only minutes pass before it is covered by the scent of the skin.\n\nThat's a bad joke at almost two euros per milliliter.\nWhat does this have to do with New York?"", 'A really great fragrance.\n\nIt is as fresh and clear as the sky. The floral fragrance is accompanied by musk.\n\nAt the beginning, there is a clear, fresh, citrusy scent, which is probably created by bergamot. But the floral heart of sweet pea, jasmine and freesia is also structured. However, sandalwood and musk take over at the end.\n\nA great fragrance for sunny days.', 'MFK\'s marketing cowboys present this as a vibrant yet urban spirit. I dunno guys, but all I get is a traditional approach to Lily-of-the-valley. Kind of soapy and slightly reminding me of home sprays. Jasmin adds a bit of fluffiness, but not enough to take away that sharp cleansing product vibe.\n\nThis is closer to grandmother Diorissimo (1956) EAU DE TOILETTE than it should be. MFK\'s interpretation falls way short of other contemporary Lily-of-the-valley, like Lucky , Cavatina and ""Synthetic Jungle | Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle"" . A big miss. Pity.', 'I’ve seen the reviews from men who don’t like this perfume and totally understand why.\nI think this scent is geared to women. It’s light, fresh, subtle, and I’m not certain most male perfume enthusiasts see that as a benefit for the price tag, and quite frankly neither do I.\nThat being said, there’s nothing wrong with the scent other than the cost.\nIt’s a great perfume for a warm day, as it’s uplifting and cool. I wouldn’t buy it, but have enjoyed my sample.', ""Absolutely GREAT fragrance! Smells TOP.\nVery fresh at the beginning, but in the drydown you can smell a lot of musk.\nI think it's great, but I also understand the rather negative opinions here.\nSuper summer fragrance, I often wear it for more special occasions such as birthdays or similar.\nProjects average, actually lasts quite well."", 'To be honest i’m quite disappointed. It’s really similar to Aqua Universalis and all the other Aquas from the brand, very simple and let me say it: cheap.

The musks in it are of good quality, as Francis used to us, and they are white. That musks gives an airy, light, clean laundry and hand soap look.

With my review, I would like to perhaps people who do not like ginger a picture of this fragrance.\n\nBriefly to my person: I do not eat ginger and also in drinks ginger scares me off. With ginger shots I always hold my nose. In fragrances, the ginger has never bothered me so far.\n\nNow to the fragrance: the ginger, the vanilla and the woods you smell throughout the fragrance. In the opening more the ginger and the base then more the vanilla, as it is shown in the pyramid. Unfortunately, the ginger in the top note smells so strong on the skin as if I bite into a ginger and taste it or it reminds me of it. This is very very unpleasant for my nose. However, after 30 min. it becomes very nice on the skin and perhaps reminds of the Stronger With You intensely. A solid fragrance for colder autumn and winter days.\n\nDo I wear the fragrance despite disturbing top note?\nYes, BUT only because my girlfriend loves him so incredibly much on my skin. She would even like me to wear the fragrance every day even in the summer. If she would not love him so much, but I would always reach for the Stronger With You intensely, not because the fragrances are 1:1, but because there simply the disturbing ginger is not there.\n\nDo I recommend the fragrance?\nDo you have no problem with ginger, then the probability is that you will love the fragrance. Are you with ginger maybe like me, I would honestly not recommend the fragrance.\n\nThanks for reading :)', 'On my masochistic journey after it again and again far too strong perfumes, with strong durability and projection, for my far too sensitive nose to buy, I have made the mistake to me The Most Wanted Parfum BLIND to buy.\nThe hype was great, the reviews great and I wanted what sweet for the winter.\n\nThe idea: Great! warm ginger vanilla and woods, oh man a dream.\nWhat you get: big red gum for 14 year olds.\n... And ne heavy confidence shake in the Perfumocommunity.\n\nHere are his strengths:\n- The projection: shrill and loud, a few meters you smell him.\n- Durability:\nReally good. 10+ loose.\n- Noseblindness: Please do not believe that just because you do not smell him after a few minutes, that he is no longer there so ""discreet"" or only ""5 hours"" shelf life I can definitely not confirm.\n\nIts weaknesses:\n- The scent: so the first few seconds and at the spray head pulls me all together a synthetic, overloaded ginger and woody note (sandalwood-like, which seems like cinnamon), which just completely overwhelms the delicate vanilla there. Sorry I have to say it so, but you can not smell it on the skin the first minutes.\nPleasant he became me as I had sprayed him on clothes and he had then said good morning to me the next morning across the bedroom, there he had a slight warm vanilligkeit you can like, but to be honest this is not a fragrance I nähe come wöllte and ...\n- The women: celebrate him now also not so much in my sample.\n\nMy recommendation:\n- Not as a blind buy.\n- Alternatively, Emporio Armani - Stronger With You or Emporio Armani - Stronger With You Intensely, Spicebomb Extreme and Spicebomb Infrared EAU DE TOILETTE or Emporio Armani - Stronger With You Absolutely for the latter I have decided and am very happy, the former are the The Most Wanted Parfum but the purpose and the ""target group age"" closer.\nCheaper: Spice & Black Vanilla by Cremo, Bentley for Men Intense , This Is Him!\n- Age range: 16-22\n- Context: club, or outside in winter\n- Occasion: no dates bro.\n\nTl;dr\nI wanted to like it, bought it blind and unfortunately I think it sucks because it\'s way too loud and squeaky.', ""The best of the whole Wanted series.

No depth, relatively unspectacular and unfortunately not gourmand in my eyes.\n\nI therefore don't understand the hype surrounding the fragrance. Sure, it's absolutely fine. It doesn't smell bad and you can wear it well, especially in winter.\n\nHowever, as the best fragrances in my opinion are often found in winter, this one has too much competition for me to make it into my collection."", '… before that I would have said that Wanted By Night was the the champion… the 2021 EDP version of The Most Wanted was a pinch too “sticky” feeling for me. It was a great scent, don’t get me wrong, but being in the southern USA, that thickness was very unforgiving. The best analogy I can think of is a melting hard candy… that’s the vibe it gives once the temperature hits a certain point.\n\nThis one though, still brings the sweetness, but it doesn’t feel as unrelenting. There’s a smokiness that alleviates the sweetness, and makes it more bearable. It’s got more of a smoky/boozy feeling sweetness to it. The Parfum lives up to the “magnum gun cylinder” more so in this sense as well, as a “bad boy” is more likely to have a “smoky” vibe than a “sticky” one used when people describe his “swagger”.\n\nThe performance is also great, projecting nicely, and leaving a direct sillage trail that points to where the cowboy has been, and who it is that is leaving that magnificent trail behind. Longevity is a good 8 hours, with the last 3-4 hours being present, but closer to the skin.\n\nThe EDP and the Parfum are very similar in scent, but the differences ARE indeed noticeable enough. Would everyone want both? Probably not. Would I buy one if I had the other? Not if I weren’t the cologne collecting madman that I am today.\n\nIt’s all about what it IS that you’re looking for; The EDP (2021) release is a great nighttime scent, with a very thick, very sticky, very sweet feeling to it. The Parfum (2022) is still sweet, but slightly more versatile (although I wouldn’t call it a daytime scent), and has a smokiness to it that sort of “lightens” the sweetness, which now has a “boozy” feel to it. Grab a couple of testers, and choose your poison.', 'The scent is reminiscent of Christmas, the Christmas market and mulled wine At the beginning it is very spicy, just its ginger direction. Over time, it transforms into a wonderful vanilla scent.\nIt lasts 8-12 hours, sillage and projection are above average.\nI can recommend this fragrance to anyone who wants to smell like Christmas!', ""I've had the perfume for a year now and it still impresses me how good the quality of azzaro the most wanted is. At the beginning it smells spicy and fruity, which then develops into a nice vanilla and tonka bean, while still smelling slightly warm and spicy. Overall, the perfume is a 9/10 for me."", 'Fall is coming, and the time to break out the fall and winter frags is near. To prepare for this, I bought three autumn fragrances over the summer, and The Most Wanted Parfum was among them. ---- If you are familiar with Wanted by Night, and The Most Wanted EDP, then the Most Wanted Parfum smells like a blend of the two fragrances. One gets the vanilla sweetness that is...', 'The perfume reminds me in some way of the red, sharp strips of bubble gum. But instead of a simple bubble gum smell, a cinnamony note is added here, which smells pleasantly warm. A very decent fragrance for the cold season.

A very spicy red ginger at the beginning, which disappears after a not so short time. But when it does, you get a woody vanilla for a while.

This is very sexy, spicy, sweet. For me, it’s in the same DNA as Stronger with you line but much more sweet, almost sugary/gourmand.

After a short time, a slight bubble gum note is added for me. However, this is barely perceptible and not too synthetic. Vanilla is added in the drydown and it develops into a very sweet, seductive fragrance.', 'a seductive and cozy warm vanilla fragrance with spicy notes. When you spray it on, the ginger is very recognizable and in the drydown the wood and vanilla notes unfold, which are simply amazing.

The scent bubble feels almost porous. It’s there, but very thin and almost “misty” feeling. It projects to about 3ft for maybe 2 hours, and then it comes very close to the skin.

Maximum to the evening an option.\nMy expectations for this perfume were high, especially because of the reactions in the statements. What I was looking for and expected? Absolutely. This ""half blind buy"" was worth it. For me, the more portable version, which is clearly reminiscent of the original. Even without Kulfi!\nThis time I chose the 100ml, especially since I like to wear sweet-spicy scents in the fall / winter times in everyday life. The 100ml are worthwhile with this definitely, because this can already make addicted and you can not sattriechen. Compliment factor is certainly also high. In the RRP, this fragrance is very expensive. I think this is at 230€, to have this is around the 140€. The latter is this absolutely worth it because of this quality and the overall package.\nPackaging is not so special with Tom Ford. A simple cardboard box, here in beautiful gold like the bottle. Must also not be so decadent in my opinion. The bottle, however, is very pretty and looks classy.\nWhich one is better? A question that you often get with flankers. Can not say here. In everyday life and versatility I like this much better, for the wow effect would possibly be the original better by this concise Kulfi note.\n\nAs I said, even without Kulfi being listed, you can recognize the original right away. This is not a flanker that stands out completely from the original. Here, however, was turned in the right places. You get a much spicier scent. Cardamom comes through well, but also a great vanilla note, which you can wear well outside of prime time. Amber and nice woody notes follow. This vanilla amber is really pleasant. Combined with spice and great woody notes. According to the pyramid, it\'s guaiac, cedar and sandalwood. Very pleasing and addictive. The drydown is soft-woody and sweet and a great finish to a great fragrance.\nPerformance is good, but not necessarily better than the EdP. Pretty much on a par. Sillage is pretty strong the first few hours, but in a pleasant sense. Durability should be between 10-12 hours, which is absolutely sufficient and perfect.\n\nFor me, on the whole, the perfect variant of this role model: very similar, but just a bit classier and more versatile. Am happy to own this fragrance in 100ml. Will be the next few years a gladly worn fragrance.', ""I have now had the opportunity to test both versions. The Noir Extreme perfume offers a warm spiciness that is perfect for cold days in fall and winter. Compared to the original, I personally miss this sweetness and I don't find the fragrance to be as long-lasting.\nNevertheless, it smells great and you can't go wrong with it.\nEveryone has to decide for themselves whether the price is reasonable. As a big fan of Stronger with you intensely, there are cheaper alternatives for me personally that also have the sweetness that I find lacking."", ""Tom Ford Noir Extreme is my third Tom Ford and as a winter and fall fragrance it's perfect for the cold season.\nThe sandalwood and tonka bean form a good base note and give the fragrance a nice depth.\nAs I said, I would only wear the fragrance on colder days, otherwise it could even be perceived as too strong.\nThe only criticism I have is the ginger note after spraying, which has a bitter aftertaste and is somehow out of place as a whole.\nNevertheless, Tom Ford Noir Extreme is a very successful perfume for winter and thick cotton sweaters."", 'I\'m not normally a big fan of heavy, sweet and creamy fragrances from this league. But when I bought Lost Cherry, my better half took me a sample of Noir Extreme Parfum, so I had to try it out.\n\nThe first time I sprayed it on, my nose wrinkled up - full-on campfire smoke that reminded me of Ombre Nomade (= not good at all, I think Ombre Nomade smells awful). After about 30 minutes, however, this unpleasant smokiness is completely gone and the fragrance settles down with a light sweetness, noble creaminess and beautiful vanilla notes, which is perfect for dark and wet fall days and is not too intrusive even in the office if you dose well.\n\nLong story short:\nThe fragrance has swept away any skepticism and is absorbed. Incidentally, I almost reached for ""Noir Extreme"" (without ""Parfum""), which smells noticeably different. Fortunately, I tried it again on a paper strip so that I noticed it. So make sure you pick the right bottle. Incidentally, this is also the only flaw in the fragrance and seems a little cheap compared to the ""Private Blend"" fragrances.', 'The original Tom Ford Noir turned into an air freshener for me on the dry down which put me right off. TF Noir Extreme EDP was a lot better but I thought the fruity, Gourmand like effect was a bit powdery and not very dark. This one…. This hits just right. It’s rich, powerful, masculine straight off the bat and then as it dries down it starts to smooth off but with still a bit of spice and depth. Ordered a bottle after one day of wear. I know I will go back to this again and again.', ""I'm not convinced that I can tell how this is wholly different from the EDP. I know I am know I am not thinking that I would be disappointed if I had requested this but had been bought the EDP instead. Its the same with Ombre Leather.

Because my first impression is often of bathroom cleaner rather than Amalfi Coast.\n\nBut not with City of Stars. While I was waiting in the LV store and browsing through the perfumes, this beautiful bottle caught my eye. The scent notes were still roughly in my head. ""That\'s not for me"" I thought, but a pink and purple bottle? That\'s definitely something for me. So I sprayed it on. Wow. Delicious. Not that typical biting citrus smell I\'m used to. It\'s a fresh blood orange with floral tiare. The other citrus fruits also come to the fore, especially the lime. But these are accompanied by sandalwood and musk, which makes this fragrance smell wonderfully soft and creamy. In my head were images of ice-cold lemonade with fresh lemon, sunscreen, a vacation in Italy.\n\nTwo weeks later: I pack my suitcase and take it with me: My sunglasses. A few clothes. SPF50.

The purchase was influenced by the enthusiastic recommendation of a very nice employee who enthusiastically praised the fragrance.\n\nAfter a few hours of testing it on my girlfriend's and my skin, we agreed that this fragrance is simply essential for summer 2022.

And that really is a great feeling.\n\nOf course, the price/performance ratio varies depending on the user.

Quite badly this was with the Guidance I really did not bear at all.\n\nThe fragrance starts very nice gourmandig and smells like baked apple with cinnamon. I was totally happy that I did not smell anything from the Akigalawood. But after a few minutes, this note then rose to my nose, at first only discreetly, but with time more intense.\n\nDirectly on the skin it remains very gourmandig for a long time, the sillage, however, consists for me really very quickly exclusively of Akigalawood.\n\nI own, by the way, the Angels' Share and can really not understand that many smell there a similarity.

The lid is made of plastic, but that is forgivable.\nSpray head also absolutely fine.\n\nThe fragrance itself is very sweet, but with a spicy note, which definitely sets it apart from other sweet winter fragrances. Over time, it becomes a little duller and more mature. Perfect for restaurant visits during the cold season. Since its DNA is not terribly complicated, there is hardly any question of whether to buy it or not. Anyone who likes sweet fragrances with a spicy, grown-up note is well advised here, especially in terms of price.

I\'m asked that too often. Let\'s just get that nasty question out of the way first, shall we?\nWhile there are certain scent profiles that seem inherintly female or male, that\'s because we as a society deem them such. Floral & sweet = female, whereas spicy-woody or clean-citrussy is male. As someone who wore (another of those horrific labels) “old lady” fragrances at 16 - meaning similar ones to my mom\'s scenterie – I don\'t care for boxes. Yes, I like sweet, I like floral, I even like fruity (which, apparently is “too young” for me, sigh). But I also like woody. And spicy. And ambery. The only reason I\'m not into leathery or yellow citrus perfumes is because my skin chemistry does awful things with it.\n\nSo many times I\'ve seen a ""homme"" fragrance\'s pyramid and thought ""Ehm, make the bottle \'girly\' and it could easily become popular on the women shelves. Sweet scents haven\'t been just for the ladies in a long time, and if you look at Middle Eastern perfumes, where the majority is unisex to begin with, you\'ll see that the guy-fums maybe have a little more (w)oudh or spice, but not always. I personally think when it comes to perfumes they have the right majority-idea: everything is for everybody.\n\nReview>>\nWhich brings me to the Fragrance of the Story: the much lauded, much hyped Lattafa -Khamrah. While it\'s officially an Arabic concoction considered the second coming of Angel\'s Share, a popular men\'s fragrance by Killian, most of us know it\'s only *loosely* inspired by the boozy apple pie juice. The bottle is duped. The scent? Meeeeh.\n\nEven though the Angels didn\'t protest to sharing, Lattafa took its pyramid, extracted what they liked most, then doubled down on their own Middle Eastern twist and voila: a gorgeous brown liquid in beautiful bottle entered YouTube Frag-circles and everyone went a lil\' cray-cray. (THX for that by the way. Not. I tested it júst after release, but had to wait for €€ to buy a full bottle. By the time I could, the hype had doubled the price here.\nEdit: after 2 Souk\'ers didn\'t reply to my ""I\'d like to buy your bottle"" I was about to get a 2nd, bigger, decant when lucky me got a Notino notification: Khamrah was back in stock AND only €44,- ex 3.95 shipping. So, I\'m going to enjoy the Lattafa next winter for the original price! ).\n\nWhich begs the question: is it really worth it? Sadly, quite often a hype is nothing more than every social media channel copying someone else to stay somewhat relevant. So, am I bravely fighting the label-posse for naught?\nTo be honest, I rarely find the prices of perfumes ""worth it"", but I do think a lot of people will like this fragrance - men and women. Fair warning though – again- : if you are attracted to Khamrah because you\'re dreaming of smelling like Angel\'s Share for a fraction of the price... don\'t buy it. There are certainly nice dupes*, with a twist and with a very close to Killian-DNA, but both in its pyramid aswell as its scent on my skin, Khamrah is simply a unisex gourmand that could be loved by Angel Share enthusiasts on its own merit. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe pyramid >>\nIf you\'re into a bit of sweet with a whole lotta kick, Khamrah will light up your day. Especially if that sweet isn\'t floral or fruity, but closer to end of the year yummies (for those countries celebrating Xmas).\n\nKhamrah has a gingerbread meets cinnamon rolls kind of sweetness with a few extra delicious things thrown in. Which isn\'t strange considering the notes of cinnamon and nutmeg in the top.\nIn the opening these two spices are strong and when they start to diminish a bit, the cinnamon never leaving completely, they get company from tuberose and milk chocolate covered dates. Yum!\n\nOn some days however, I had an issue with that tuberose. I\'m unsure if it was my hormone levels, my diet or something else, but there were certainly moments when the tuberose turned skanky, ruining the entire composition, overpowering everything else in the juice. Think of throwing away a bouquet of flowers that has been standing a few days too long. You take them out of the vase, inhale the leftover water, aaand get a very distinct sweet-sour, almost rotting smell. Thàt. Thàt.\nRuined Khamrah for me. It could be the bergamot pullling strongly, mixing with the white flower and turning her indolic. It is why – in case I\'m not alone – I recommend spread testing with a decant. Not a blind buy.\n\nOn the days the note, or better said: my skin, behaved the flower simply added sweetness that translated somehow as a very coconutty heart – straight into the base.\n\nThat base leans heavily on vanilla and the three woods; Mahogany from the heart, and Akigala + Amber woods on the bottom tier. Here and there the benzoin and myrrhe give it extra depth and warmth. I\'ve often heard describe Khamrah as “boozy”, but I\'m not getting any of that. Just like the apple pie has never entered my olfactory senses when wearing this chique Lattafa.\n\nThese are just two of the reasons why, for me, Khamrah is its own fragrance. A gourmand that might attract Angel\'s Share lovers because those are gourmand lovers – not due to the overwhelming similarities. I honestly think Lattafa made a smart marketing move with the packaging. YouTube & TikTok did the rest.\n\nSo, I\'m not getting a Killian, but what I dó get – save the sometimes issue with the tuberose – is a wonderful set of spicy and mature gourmand sweet accords with a coconutty-date heart that\'ll be great on anyone and everybody. As long as you like smelling like a snack.\n\nWhile Khamrah unfolds and follows different steps in the pyramid it\'s in many ways pretty linear. The first whiffs are a good indication of what you\'ll keep. You\'ll just get a tad more sweetness from the very edible heart and a vanilla-warm-woody base to have both a longer lasting effect and depth. That spicy cinnamonroll/gingerbread opening stays with you - though in a more subdued way.\n\nProjection and sillage are moderate. Longevity is ...hours. And hours. Which came as quite the surprise. My skin doesn\'t project and “eats perfume”, making beastmode fragrances and very longlasting scents a near impossibility. Khamrah does it though. Even a first test with one spray on the top of my hand stayed for 8 hours. A full wear remained even longer and kept a moderate projection quite constantly. I\'ve not tested on clothes, as I rarely do so, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if that would result in a 24h+ wear.\n\nKhamrah is whatever you want it to be, but I assume most people\'ll wear this fragrance in the colder months of the year. It is also when it performs best, though I have worn it to bed in Fall and cooler Spring days.\n\nAll-in-all: while the original reason for the hype is weak (dupe), many have definitely, accurately designated Khamrah\'s worth. The fragrance can measure itself with scent and quality against a niche caliber juice and come out, if not on top, then certainly holding an award for “Best Middle Eastern Gourmand of 2022 with excellent marketing”.\nNB* I\'ve tested several dupes/inspired by Angel\'s Share and am considering a short blog describing them all.', 'Today I evaluate once my latest acquisition. I was able to test the ""Khamrah"" now for 2 days and must now simply give my two cents.\n\nIn short: It was love at first ""Sniff""!!! Me envelops a breath of Christmas market - and although the season has not yet started. A scent of warm apple strudel and baked apple embraces me. Based on this, I must note that I would rather not wear this scent on a summer day now. In the autumnal ""dirty weather"", however, he fits perfectly.\nI do not feel currently in a position to wear another fragrance.\nAbout the durability, I can say that he holds about 6-8h on the skin with me. On my clothes I perceive him longer. The sillage is extremely strong at the beginning, but falls off with time.\nGenerally, he holds but a working day well through. Who still wants to the ""after-work party"", can like to re-spray.', '... can be quite helpful! At least that\'s what I discovered when I enriched my personal Parfumo series with a repeat of the ""Angel\'s Share"" episode and the ""Khamrah"" episode, which had been removed from the program...\nI was very fascinated by the bottle and the notes of Angel\'s Share shortly after it was released - and by the fragrance too. So soft, so round, so elegantly alcoholic... Unfortunately, I got tired of the fragrance shortly afterwards. And sold it again. So far, so good.\nOn one of these days, when I was tired of making decisions - decision fatigue, I read, is a symptom of my job, in which I make up to 1,500 decisions a day - and lolling listlessly in front of YouTube, I saw a video in which Angel\'s Share was very much slated. Because I think so little of the source of this channel, this video almost challenged me: ""Bad? Okay. I\'ll watch it again.""\nUnfortunately, I found Angel\'s Share quite expensive. And THAT was the moment when Khamrah appeared on the scene. Enthusiasm! Great bottle! Great pyramid! Great comments! And a wonderful prize!\nKhamra quickly moved in with me and I thought I now had my Angel\'s Share back. But unfortunately that wasn\'t the case. I was so bitterly disappointed. Khamrah is, as many write here, really a fragrance in its own right. But I don\'t think it needs to hide behind Angel\'s Share. I don\'t get on well with it. I do perceive the subtle spicy tones, but there is something so harsh, dull and dark in the background that I find it rather unpleasant to wear after a short time. I don\'t find this harshness masculine at all, that\'s not the problem. It\'s just that I find the fragrance relatively flat, it doesn\'t go into depth, doesn\'t spread out in developments, doesn\'t lead along winding paths to drydowns that surprise, but remains very linear and very intense in my eyes, and that builds up in front of me like a wall that is simply too powerful for me. In my opinion, the fragrance lacks the softness that makes it possible to wear spice fragrances at all. I don\'t eat cooking spices on their own, a teaspoon of cinnamon or even nutmeg would be extremely unpleasant (and probably also very unhealthy). For me, spices need to be integrated into a soft, restrained base, to which they add the finishing touch like diamonds to an elegant, simple dress. They have to make the base sparkle, and they must not appear pure. One idea I like about Khamrah is the smell of warm apples with a slight acidity, such as Boskoop, associations with warm apple pie. But in Khamrah, this note overwhelms me, as if the apples were not embedded in soft, tender, buttery shortcrust pastry, but in fresh concrete. Khamrah is therefore not the right fragrance for me. And so, in the end, my path led me back to Angel\'s Share, which I won\'t give away again and won\'t share with any angels.', '... the time will come when I can finally unpack Khamrah again!\n\nIf you\'re as perfume-crazy on TikTok as we are here, I think Khamrah is really hard to pass up in the long run.\nI\'ve had it for a year now, when it was still rare at times, so I ""had"" to buy it blind. Was it worth it?\n\nIf you\'re looking for a 1:1 dupe of Angels\' Share, you won\'t find it here in my opinion. The vibe is similar. Okay\nBut for me, Khamrah is a completely independent fragrance with a unique, WONDERFUL DNA.\nGood - and the bottle would work.\n\nKhamrah opens incredibly warm for me. Delicately spicy - not masculine-dominated spicy! - and cinnamony. Pleasantly sweet. There are many fragrances that are sweet and become unpleasant. With Khamrah, I don\'t feel that at any time. If I sniff VERY intensely, I can actually smell a tiny bit of tuberose. But it seems a little lost among the spices. However, I don\'t detect an apple note at all. Personally, I would rather associate it with fresh, still warm cinnamon buns. Dates. Roasted almonds. Wintertime or cold fall. It pushes aside any winter depression and brightens up any gloomy day.\n\nH/S are incredibly good. It fills rooms (for me) and receives endless compliments.\n\nFor value for money, (once again) the packaging, the heavy bottle: absolute go!', 'People who think that this isn’t worth up to $150, either don’t own any single niche fragrance, and hence, prejudiced, or they’re just complete biased haters, that have this illogical and wrong view on Lattafa, prolly because they do clones. And here lies my problem with society—the inability to judge things, open-minded!\nBut I digress.\n\nKhamrah opens up with sweet mix of dates, wine accord, cinnamon and something coconut-y. I do get a kind of woody/leathery vibe in the background. It progresses over time and loses that dates smell and becomes kinda balsamic and woody; with vanilla, Tonka bean(also detected in the opening), woods and myrrh being the star here. I don’t wanna go in depth on the smell, as it’s still new to me and many people have already done justice to that.\n\nThe performance on this, is mind blowing. Put this on my arm, an hour later, I took a nap and woke up 2 hours later and was like “Jeez, what’s this beautiful aroma?”, then I realized I sprayed Khamrah... and lo and behold, it was just as if I was just spraying it. It’s just too strong and loud. I just got it and It’s been 5-6 hours now and it’s still loud.\n\nEven tho I know quite some things, I’m still not a big fragrance expert, but I can tell you that I have smelt heavily synthetic bad fragrances that costs over $25, but this is just as smooth as hell. This is beauty personified, and I’ve used and tested hundreds of Lattafas. If you think that most Alharamain Amber Oud range is okay for over $80 for 70ml(I think), and this is too much for the $65+ for 100ml it’s going for, then you’re biased. This is the exact problem I had with a reviewer that said Roja Apex is like the ‘niche version’ of Sauvage elixir... WTF! Just because it’s Roja doesn’t make it any better!!!!!!!! Fraghead(most especially the niche snobs) should stop these irrationalities!', ""Khamrah is not a fragrance, it is the absolute power you can wield in your hands. Sniffing it for the first time, I was completely blown away. Transport yourself to a world of sensation and depth of fragrance with just one puff. A very unobtrusive bergamot opens perfectly in the head note leading it's way to the good booze - a very balanced sweetness combined with a creamy alcoholic note and cinnamon gives a sense of immense luxury. The great complement to this fragrance is date and praline, doing the atmosphere of an expensive gourmand wrapped up in 24 karat gold. In the end we are led into the bottomless abyss by myrrh and vanilla, making both an indispensable base scent for icy days. The perfume is decidedly unisex, with no emphasis on either side. If you want to dazzle those around you and receive a wave of compliments, this is the fragrance you should choose without hesitation. The longevity is very strong, after using the perfume you can smell for up to several days on your clothes. There is absolutely no need to reapply during the day, unless you want to smell even more intense. The bottle itself is very well made and the packaging is stunning. The Lattafa brand has once again done a great job. Something so well composed for such a small price is something you don't come across everyday. If you can get your hands on it, buy it."", 'After all the ""hype"" I wanted to try this fragrance too. Now I\'ve bought it too. The perfume blew me away after the first spray! A very beautiful and sweet fragrance, which is perfect for the winter and Christmas season. The durability as well as the sillage is very good for this price. The perfume goes in the direction of ""Emporio Armani Stronger with You Intensely""\n\nConclusion: I would definitely recommend the fragrance to anyone who likes winter perfumes and who also likes the oriental/sweet direction. The price is around 40€, you can\'t go far wrong with it!', 'I really like the scent, its amazing for the price and quality. Amazing performance, i smell it for like 3-4 hours in the air quite strong, after that it starts to settle down, but i can still smell it on me for 8 to 10 hours. I also got some compliments by my co-workers. In conclusion i recommend this perfume.', 'I have seen on Tiktok constantly as many Lattafa fragrances were hyped, including Khamrah. The opinions on Parfumo were divided therefore I have bought me first a bottling.\n\nTo me: I generally do not like very loud and penetrating fragrances that could possibly disturb my fellow human beings.\nNow to Khamrah:\nI sprayed the sample on a strip and the first thing I smelled was quite a lot of spice and a strong woody smell. No date, no cinnamon, no bergamot, no vanilla...\nOnly strong spicy smelling (in my mind wet) wood.\nI smelled it again after half an hour and was very disappointed. It did not smell like a delicious vanilla baked apple fragrance as others described it.\n\nThen I thought ""that can not be"" and sprayed the fragrance on my wrist..\nThe first minutes smelled the fragrance again like wet spicy wood (@Bianca78 wrote ""Grandma\'s old wooden cabinet"" which it meets perfectly) BUT THEN IT PASSED.\nOn my wrist, the scent started to develop sweeter. The spice was still there, but wasn\'t the sole focus. There was a very delicious sweetness to it, which harmonized very well. The scent suddenly became so pleasant. I smelled the dates, tonka bean and vanilla out so well, which now made the scent a creamy, spicy and VERY DELICIOUS scent. I had to keep smelling my wrist because it smelled incredibly delicious.\n\nMy conclusion:\nI like the fragrance extremely well and I can imagine him in the cold winter very well. He is very warm through the spice and has a syrupy sweetness through the dates, in addition he also smells something boozy (like rum). In the drydown, the scent becomes very pleasant and smells like a delicious cuddly scent to me. Somehow this fragrance also stimulates my appetite.\nThe sillage is rather medium and makes it wearable in everyday life (if you do not overspray him).\nI\'m looking forward to use up the bottling and possibly order me a bottle.', 'Christmas last year - my boyfriend gives me Khamrah by Lattafa, and I can\'t wait to try it out. My first fragrance from Lattafa and immediately so confused. What is that? My first thought: ""Oh God no... that\'s not me!"" I don\'t recognize myself. Unfortunately, I have to give it back to my boyfriend because it suits him. Sometimes it\'s like a striking color. Although you admire it on others, you know it doesn\'t suit you. I think because I was somehow told that, being blonde, I should only wear flowery, fresh fragrances, it threw me off track.\n\nFor me, the initial notes are characterized by cinnamon and a hint of brandy. Then everything thickens a little, the dates enrich the fragrance and it becomes rich and dark. A scent like from a café that sells specially spiced pastries during the Christmas season. You wait excitedly at the counter and take in everything around you. It smells of cinnamon, chocolate and cake. A cinnamon bun with apples is the order of the day. If you want, you can get a hot chocolate with cinnamon. After all the excitement in the café, you sit down, a candle burns next to you and you get used to all the sounds and smells. It gets cozy, and the candle smells of vanilla and faintly of wood. It\'s homely.\n\nI really have to thank Lattafa, because little by little I\'ve been venturing into Beast Mode fragrances like this. It was almost an awakening of oriental, powerful perfumes. I can\'t imagine my collection without this treasure. My boyfriend and I have to share it because now he doesn\'t want to give it up either. I have received sooo many compliments and just feel comfortable and magical when I wear it.', 'I don\'t know the AS but through most digital media and this site you have to stumble across this fragrance at some point, which is often compared to the AS.\nThe components sounded interesting and the many reports made me curious, so I got myself a sample (the low price convinces you very quickly).\nThe first impression after spraying it on is sweet, very sweet. I only detect cinnamon minimally and briefly. A slight sweetness remains the whole time, which is joined by a rather artificial vanilla note with a ""buttery"" aroma. I can\'t describe it any other way.\nThe fragrance is very present at first, but I don\'t have this extremely long-lasting fragrance experience.\nFor the price, you certainly can\'t go far wrong but I would recommend a small sample before buying. Even though the fragrance is stated as unisex, I personally see it more on women.', ""Batch 05/2023. This scent, is otherworldly. This is WAY different then Alexandria BFL which is supposedly one of the best clones of Amgel share. Still I haven't smelled KAS, but this is absolutely insane! You get a soft floral, woody, creamy BOOZY scent. The floral is apparent, and compliments the warm cinnamon booze OUTSTANDINGLY. This is a top frag, imo. I just sprayed 30 mins ago, so no talk on longevity or sillage, but the sillage is there for 30 minutes at least. Huge sillage too. Amazing stuff. For 40$ you will NOT find a better scent!!!!"", 'Well, the fragrance could come from an angel, and it\'s not only here that a similarity to Angels Share is drawn.\nBut what Angels Share does in Boozyness, Khamrah tackles differently with a date-like, almost ""Christmassy"" spicy note - and I like that. Here, you don\'t have the feeling that you\'re smelling too much mulled wine, but rather as if you\'re enveloped in a cozy, sweet olfactory mantle.\n\nThe longevity is also great: it\'s not incredibly penetrating for going out and after a few hours it settles in so close that it\'s still perfect for cuddling.\n\nFor this price, definitely a no-brainer for fall and winter, neither man nor woman can go wrong.', ""I bought this fragrance blindly after reading a few reviews of Lattafa-Khamra. I didn't have a hard time with it because the price of 30 euros for 100ml doesn't involve much risk.\n\nThe perfume arrived and I was totally delighted with the presentation, as you would expect from our Arab friends. The box is very high quality and the bottle, of course a cuboid Angels Share bottle, looks very nice and high quality.\n\nNow let's get to the fragrance, I sprayed the stuff on the back of my hand and for the first 10 seconds I got an alcohol sillage around my hand, I had expected this as this is often the case with cheaper perfumes.\nAbout 10 seconds later I had a wonderful delicious scent. Dates, cookies and honey, everything imaginable in this direction, but also a bit of boozyness, which is much more dominant in Angels Share, was in the air. The fragrance is very strong and has a strong sillage and is very well received by people around you, definitely a compliment magnet. Unfortunately, this fragrance hardly has any noticeable development, but that's not a bad thing, this fragrance is ridiculously strong for this price, Lattafa could have charged a few euros more. A great companion for the winter, super delicious, very often I applied this fragrance to my hand just to be able to smell this delicious scent while working, this is also due to the fact that you have a great tendency to become smell-blind with Khamra, which should not irritate you in any case because this fragrance is clearly perceptible and has a super sillage. Overall a perfect, evening fragrance for fall and winter, a super strong buy."", ""As a fan of Angels' Share, the hype surrounding the Khamrah has of course not escaped me. And for the price, you can't really go wrong. But what the fragrance has to do with Angels' Share is still not clear to me. My passion for gourmand fragrances is just as great as my passion for sweet fragrances. Despite this, I couldn't quite make friends with Khamrah.\n\nKhamrah is definitely an attention magnet, how could it be otherwise with such an obtrusively over-the-top perfume. Fortunately, the penetrating, exaggerated sweetness, which I find unpleasant, recedes in the drydown. What remains is a less exaggerated sweetness and the gourmand character breathes a sigh of relief.\n\nHowever, the fragrance is too flat and somewhat synthetic for me; it lacks dynamism. And if I had to smell this scent on someone all the time, it would be more headache than pleasant."", 'I ordered the fragrance blind.\nA real bargain at 40 euros for 100 ML and great for winter.\n\nThe fragrance reminds me of a Christmas baked apple with cinnamon, covered in melted praline. You have to like sweet scents.\n\nBrutal longevity with strong sillage. Seductive and suitable for the masses. Top for the price.', ""Had tested a sample of the Angel's Share months ago and so came across the Khamrah of Lattafa. Tjo, and here is now my review.\n\nFrom the first spray, I felt transported to a sweet, smoldering oriental dream. Dates, really sugary sweet dates, framed by intense vanilla and a vibrant hint of cinnamon. So you must be into sweet stuff otherwise better stay away from this right away! After the first opulent sweetness settles a bit, the fragrance becomes woodier and more mysterious, with this warm, almost soothing note, but never completely displaces the sweet tones.\n\nThe sillage? A beast! You'll be smelled before you enter the room. And the longevity is impressive, it sticks to you all day and beyond.\n\nOf course there are some parallels to the Angel's Share by Kilian, but then the Khamrah is its own thing. Sweeter, not boozy and overall different. Find both good!\n\nIn a sentence: for the price it is worth a try, but beware of a blind purchase if you are not the biggest fans of intensely sweet, opulent fragrances!"", ""And as the title might suggest, we are heading in the direction of the Kilian Angels Share.\n\nATTENTION: We are talking about the direction & not a 1:1 dupe.\n\nMany will probably have become aware of this fragrance as a dupe or imitation of the well-known Kilian perfume.\nI can tell you straight away, it's not the same fragrance & yet it shines!\nHow do you ask yourselves?\nI'll explain it.\n\nThe DNA is clearly the same or very similar, it's supposed to be a gourmand - so a fragrance that I personally would not only smell but also eat.\n\nThe difference to the much more expensive cousin is the unbeatable price (approx. 40-50€) & the fragrance notes. This one is much lighter and generally gives me baked apple vibes the first time I spray it on. That means the sweetness of the date, praline and yes, some cinnamon can be smelled right away. The vanilla is also definitely present in the undertone.\n\nI personally can't smell the bergamot, so no fresh kick.\n\nIn the end, the Khamrah sticks sweetly to you & everyone who hugs you will definitely notice it. But it also means that it is not so penetrating. Others may only notice it directly in front of you. I myself have been smelling it permanently on myself since this morning.\n\nSo if you don't mind the lasting sweetness & you wanted something along the lines of Angels Share, but the price was the catch, you can confidently buy the Khamrah, at 40€ you can't go wrong."", 'For me, a perfect symbiosis of baked apple paired with cinnamon and honey.\nThe durability and sillage surprise me every time. It literally sticks to the skin and clothing. Even after 3 days where you had already forgotten that you had sprayed the jacket with it, you are immediately reminded of it again.\nMy go-to fall/winter fragrance! Just reminds you of Christmas and a good time with your loved ones.', ""My impressions:\nBaked apple, sweet, roasted almonds, cotton candy, gourmand.\nLittle fragrance progression, but extremely delicious throughout! At the beginning, I notice a minimal synthetic off-note from time to time, but really minimal.\nSo minimal that I almost didn't want to tell you.\nIt may also be due to the form of the day.\n\nPurely in terms of presentation, of course, an Angels' Share clone. In terms of scent, I don't necessarily think so, although the two are very similar.\nWhere Khamrah focuses on the sweet apple, the competitor focuses on cinnamon and vice versa.\nAlthough I must confess that I only own one bottling of Angels' Share.\nHowever, I would definitely also give it a certain boozy note!\nIt's obviously perfect for Christmas markets, Christmas parties and the entire Advent season.\nOtherwise also very versatile to wear if you don't overdo it with the quantity.\nDefinitely unisex.\n\nConclusion:\nAs known from many Lattafa fragrances, the price / performance of this representative is of course top notch! That's not the only reason why I always reach for the bottle, I like it! Nevertheless: Attention, very sweet...\nPackaging / presentation: Full marks, you could easily pay 5 times the price for this! Would - and will - clearly prefer it to its relatives (from Kilian)!"", ""Wow...\nI was afraid that this perfume again like the oud stories of Lataffa before Lauter oud and patchouli nothing else is perceptible and is much too coarse.\nBut I was in love from the first second.\nThe fragrance is not as loud as the above fragrances. He is quite perceptible and present but not intrusive and annoying.\nHe smells delicious and unique.\nIt definitely reminds of autumn and winter. Like a delicious Christmas scented candle only as a perfume.\nIt smells like Christmas cookies but pleasantly wearable. I'm not really a fan of smelling like food but it's really warm and nice.\nHe warms the heart when one is cold.\nFor everyday life suitable, work I do not know but evenings definitely also.\n\nCinnamon, nutmeg, spicy strong praline. A little sweet but spicy at the same time. The vanilla makes it warm.I'm not disappointed I'm so glad to have bought him yet after much deliberation. And the packaging and the bottle ... you just have to leave it there as a display."", ""I bought it because everyone was comparing it to Angels Share, but it's not. The only similarities are the gourmand vibe and the bottle.\nThe fragrance is really cool and I mean really good very good indeed. The perfume starts directly with the praline sitting on the date with some cinnamon on top. It's really, really delicious. Then comes vanilla which plays together with the tonka bean. The scent in general is sweet but not overpoweringly sweet that you get tired of it, it's really well rounded and fun to wear. It is a light sweetness, you could also say transparent sweetness, because it mixes with a light freshness that I unfortunately cannot describe\nThe presentation is simply top, so it couldn't really be better and the bottle itself looks really great. However, you have to make compromises with the lid because it's really weird to close and the sprayer is really very weak but it does its job.\n\nThe durability is above average. You get at least 8 hours of the perfume on the skin and also several days in the clothes. The perfume has a very good sillage, you are often asked about it and you notice the smell again and again.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this perfume. Whether you are a man or a woman, the fragrance suits both very well. An absolute unisex with a top price-performance ratio."", 'So far in my 2 years or so of my fragrance journey, and having sampled approximately 500 different fragrances, this is #1 for me in terms of the best value of any fragrance so far. Another reviewer described it as ""Christmas in a bottle"", and I couldn\'t agree more. While it\'s decidedly NOT a clone of Angels\' Share, I\'d say this is almost an ""inspired by"" fragrance with a holiday twist. My batch is full of booze and cinnamon, and while I don\'t get as much of the dates/praline as others have mentioned, it\'s just as delightfully rich, deep and complex as any By Kilian fragrance, even Angels\' Share. I got mine for $30, and I simply cannot believe that such a high-quality fragrance could be had for such a low price. Utterly amazing.', ""After Interlude, Khamrah was the second fragrance that hit me like a nuclear bomb. You know immediately that this is something special. And every time you smell it again, your desire for a bottle grows. The benchmark for outstanding perfumes. As soon as your desire for a bottle grows, you know you've hit the jackpot again. This doesn't happen too often, but that's a good thing, because it has to remain something special.\n\nThe Khamrah came as a small bottling from my brother-in-law. It was so delicious, I would have loved to drink it. Something like a brandy, cognac-like, gourmand. It was the fall of '22 and there was already a little hype about it in the perfume world, it was nowhere to be found. If it was available online for a short time, you had to be quick, it was immediately out of stock again.\n\nThen I had it in December. A beautiful presentation, a great presentation, in which a high-quality, beautiful, cognac bottle-like flacon is set against a quasi-mirrored background in a wood-like box. And something in this price range. Compliments.\n\nWhen you wear it, you stand out. You'll be talked about.\nH/S at the top level.\nOf course it's a fall/winter fragrance, but I also wear it in other seasons because I would miss it otherwise. From 25 degrees onwards, however, it becomes too heavy and not only overwhelms you, but also the others.\n\nIncidentally, the fragrance pyramid on lattafa.de differs slightly. Unlike the pyramid published here, it lists cognac, among other things.\n\nI would currently call it no. 3 in my ranking."", ""Very disappointed. After all the mega enthusiastic reviews and videos I thought that was now my winter Christmas fragrance. But nope. First of all. The packaging is mega elegant. The bottle also. Only the plastic lid is a little stupid and does not go grad easy to.\nThen you spray. In the first seconds quite nice. Like an apple strudel that you have soaked in cognac or whiskey. Then ne quarter hour later, the arm smells like grandma's old wooden cabinet. Again a little later, it suddenly smells again slightly like apple pie, this time with some cinnamon in the cognac. This goes back and forth for a while and then everything is gone. In the meantime, I think it's me. Well. \u200d️ Does not last long. Stinks more than it smells and from the ingredients I can hardly recognize one."", 'The perfume Kamrah is truly a masterpiece in my opinion ( considering the low price well understood). Those who are not willing to pay the price for the Angels Share and are looking for a cheap alternative, but are well served by this. Unlike the Angels Share, however, a boozy rum note is completely missing here. So , Well enough of the comparison of two completely...', ""After hundreds of reviews and explicit recommendations on Tiktok and YT, I decided to buy the fragrance and was extremst gespannt.\nİch had always wondered how gourmandig and delicious should be taken up, which I had always read in reviews.\nAnd when the fragrance arrived, I finally understood what delicious could mean.\nMy father sprayed himself first. It was just to bite into, absolutely delicious. Really reminds you of a winter's day - you smell cinnamon, apple pie, vanilla (it kind of reminded me a bit of baklava şerbet - just seductive) - generally sweet yummy notes, but they are anything but strong and annoying.\n\nI absolutely loved the scent, but my problem with Khamrah is the longevity. İch could not even a whole hour the fragrance strongly perceived. Everything after 20 minutes were only so light perceptions.\nAfter 3-4 hours on the skin actually almost nothing.\nSillage was strangely enough on the skin of my father mega blatant. İch was positively surprised, what a broad scent cloud it leaves behind - I was in love. But with me max. 3/10.\n\nGenerally, therefore, very nice fragrance, with poor durability and also relatively weak sillage.\nContrary to all the reviews, the performance was with me so not so good, unfortunately. I try the fragrance also times with Vaseline."", ""In my search for a really sweet, gourmand Christmas fragrance, I inevitably stumbled across the recommendation for Khamrah. The descriptions of a cinnamon-praline Christmas market dream made me curious - that sounded exactly like the scent I was looking for! When it finally arrived, I was almost excited. Then the first spray and...confusion. Then disappointment. The one on my wrist didn't smell like Christmas and gourmand comfort at all, but more like an unspectacular, almost pretentious men's perfume. I blame the bergamot in the top note for this, as it inevitably reminds me of Dior Sauvage in every fragrance - and I really don't like it very much. So it's a purely personal problem on my part. I couldn't perceive cinnamon and nutmeg in the opening at all.\n\nSo I waited. And it was worth it. Within minutes, the fragrance transformed on my skin, becoming sweeter and softer. The jostling, synthetic-macho quality gave way to a cinnamon-sprinkled date praline on vanilla pudding. Gentle, sweet and almost sticky, without making you sick. There was also a certain fruitiness, the scent was reminiscent of a Christmas market - but also somehow of the confectionery department of a luxury department store at Christmas time: chocolates, fruit confectionery and spiced cookies. The vanilla makes its presence felt on the finish: it is clearly perceptible after a few hours of wear and dominates.\n\nLongevity is really good (still absolutely perceptible after 8 hours of wear) and it also radiates without being overpowering - but I think you should spray with caution.\nI am positively surprised by this blind purchase, but it should be mentioned here that it really is a unisex fragrance that is slightly masculine. But for adult women who don't like it too playful and girly, it's definitely wearable."", 'Anyone who likes sweet fragrances is in good hands with Khamrah.\nWhen I sprayed it on for the first time, I immediately knew that this fragrance would accompany me through the cold days.\nYou are enveloped in a cozy warmth that almost makes your mouth water.\nThe date definitely dominates here, bedded on a praline, which is then surrounded by a slightly cinnamony vanilla tonka coat.\nDefinitely a gourmand fragrance that is sweet but not too overpowering.\nKhamrah has become my winter comfort fragrance par excellence, like a sweet veil that envelops me and gives me a feeling of security and warmth.\n\nThe longevity and the price-performance ratio are simply outstanding. It is definitely perceptible for a relaxed 8 hours, which is longer on clothing.\nA clear recommendation from me!', ""I've had the Lattafa Kamrah for 3 days now and spray it on every day. It took some getting used to on the first day, as I'm not used to such oriental/gourmand scents.\n\nNow it's day 3 and I'm loving it! It starts off very, very sweet - stays that way until the end, just a little less sweet. The start is still not my thing, but as soon as the heart note appears, the Kamrah is really, really good and has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances - at least for the winter.\nSince the fragrance is really sweet, I think it's more suitable for fall/winter. Maybe spring in the evening, but less so in summer. Although vanilla is apparently present in the base note, I notice this flavor very early on - which is an absolute plus for me.\n\nI can imagine the perfume on women and men, in my opinion it suits both equally.\n\nLongevity and sillage are very good - you can feel it all day long, beautifully enveloped in a sweet, feel-good cloud.\n\nThe bottle is beautiful and solid. The lid, on the other hand, is cheaply made and the atomizer is not my thing: doesn't spray as nicely and in too narrow a stream.\n\nI'm amazed at the quality, especially as I only paid CHF 60 for it - I have other fragrances that are far more expensive and give less - be it the fragrance itself, the durability or the sillage.

In my mind's eye, this fragrance creates a hot dune landscape. In the middle of this wasteland is a small oasis. Magnificent date trees grow here, exuding their honey-sweet scent. A shady spot invites you to rest. It is time for a hot Tässchen, sweet black tea and something spice cake in addition.\n\nThe variety of these flavors envelops my senses.

With its gourmand cinnamon bun scent, it is very similar to its role model, but it also has deviations, which I don't see as negative at all. A date is added, which makes the fragrance a little less round, but all the more exciting as a result. It takes its time, becoming more and more pleasant and vanilla-like. As usual with Lattafa, the longevity and sillage are above average, I find 2 sprays to be optimal. In terms of price, you can do anything but complain...\nAll in all, a wonderful fragrance that I wore mainly during the holidays.

It fills up the space where you are while applying it and behaves like a high-end air freshner for a good 30 minutes or so. It is perfect for freezing nights and really cold mornings. The ladies like it, people often ask me what perfume I am wearing, and they highly compliment it. It is strange and mysterious. Just don\'t spray too much, because, besides being a master piece, Kharma is an aggressive perfume.', ""It's been a while since i wrote a review so i may be a little rusty but spraying it on this morning inspired me to write something about it as these images popped in to my mind and warmed my heart. This fragrance has invoked a feeling of well being, images of coming home to a loved one after a day of being out doing fun things and your love has been baking some sweet apple..."", ""I'm just amazed , stunned how wonderfull lattafa did these product...25$ thats the price i paid for it\nAnd let me just tell how i enjoyed every cent of it , the scent was really enjoyable\nToday the weather is 10C and its smells so fresh so nice\nEveryone who smelled it loved it\nProjection and longevity i tried only three sprays but i think are not enough go for 5-6 but damn it do lasts long even with little sprays,\nBottle was great too , package you may even think of it as a premium parfum\nThe only bad thing the weak atomizer\nAnd to open cap apply pressure and rotate it ,it will come off\nAnyways i really loved it by far my fav lattafa one\n9/10"", 'I really enjoy the scent profile and the opening, however this scent lasts longer than what I expected, i enjoy wearing it , but not for too long , i get bored after 6-8 hours , and after 4 hours it becomes really cheap smelling in my opinion .\n\nDo I suggest it ?\n\nYeah go for it , it’s a good addition to a small collection, but if u have alot of perfumes, I don’t think this will be anything special to you .', 'Khamrah by Lattafa is a very much hyped fragrance that is said to resemble Angels share by Kilian. It’s a Spicy boozy sweet scent with some reminiscences of oud. It’s kinda loud and long lasting, especially on clothes.\nIf you are interested in a video review please take a look at the YouTube video linked here below.', ""When I sprayed the fragrance for the first time I was immediately in love. However, I don't smell what you would expect from the scent pyramid. It smells very much like pastry. In the direction of apple strudel. It's a great Christmas scent that becomes more vanilla after a while. The price-performance ratio of this fragrance is simply unbeatable. H/S super for the price range. Highly recommended. For winter / fall top fragrance"", 'A very lovely mild and creamy sweet vanilla winter fragrance that I am currently wearing. 2-3 sprays are completely sufficient.\nKhamrah really cuts through the cold and the durability is also great. The packaging is classy and the bottle is impressive. However, something quickly came loose on the lid, a magnetic lid would have been the icing on the cake here', ""I bought Khamra because it is often compared to Kilian Angels Share. I personally think that Khamra has a very unique note but definitely goes in that direction. For 30-40€ for the bottle, you really can't go wrong if you like Christmassy, gourmand scents. For me, it smelled like a spicy apple juice right after I bought it, which I was a bit disappointed about at first. Now after 2 months I have the feeling that the fragrance is maturing, it has become much stronger and the rum note comes out very well. I don't think I need to say anything about the bottle, even if I don't like the scent it's an absolute eye-catcher."", 'Sweet, gourmand, syrupy, warm spicy, vanilla. The first time I smelled it my reaction was ""what the f**!"" my nose rejected it straight away. Upon wearing it the second time I actually started liking it and now I LOVE it. Performance is outstanding, just a few sprays and you are done for the whole day. Strictly for cold days, might choke you out on hot days. The glass bottle...', ""Tried the Khamra from lattafa for the first time today and I have to say it's one of the best winter fragrances you immediately have cinnamon and date in your nose which reminds you of Christmas as you hear from time to time it's a dupe to the angel share from Kilian,\nI wouldn't say that because it's a completely different scent and the Khamra is a fragrance in its own right\nSweet oriental gourmand in all top fragrance"", ""The fragrance is really very, very sweet. I am someone who likes to spray more than just 3 times and I bitterly regretted it. It was so strong that even I constantly had a scratchy throat because I unfortunately sprayed too much a few times. For the office or other human-related professions, you should really be careful to only apply 1-2 sprays, of course if you are outside and wearing a thick jacket underneath anyway, 3-4 sprays are also fine. The fragrance gets compliments, it is just a very sweet praline / date / apple-cinnamon cake fragrance, someone has already written that it also smells a bit buttery, I can confirm this, as if you would add vanilla sugar to melted butter. I have no idea how you can smell bergamot here. No citrus note perceptible for me. To be honest, I don't know the Killian fragrance and wouldn't want to for the price.\nIf you like sugar bombs, give it a try, it reminds me a lot of Shaghaf Oud in terms of sillage and sweetness. I would rather smell the fragrance on a woman, much too sweet for a man, but even as a man I could get one or two compliments."", ""Wow! That was my first thought when I sprayed Khamrah on for the first time.\nI ordered Khamrah because many people compare it to Angels Share, which I also really like. I quickly realized that the two fragrances actually have relatively little in common. But that's not a bad thing, quite the opposite.\n\nKhamrah is one of the most delicious gourmand fragrances I have ever smelled. You just want to eat this fragrance.\nTo me, the fragrance smells like an incredibly delicious dessert after Christmas dinner.\n\nAt this price, you really can't go wrong and I think the fragrance is also incredibly suitable for the masses.\nAn absolute blind buy in my eyes.\nIf you get the chance to get hold of a bottle, don't hesitate, you definitely won't go wrong and this fragrance will enrich anyone's perfume collection."", 'Phew, where do I start. I let myself be hyped by some perfume youtubers about the fragrance back then and thought it had to move in with me. I must be a hype victim xD\n\nLet\'s spray the fragrance on. Oh yes, the fragrance really hits the spot! I smell cinnamon, lots and lots of cinnamon. It\'s also very sweet, almost a little sticky. It\'s like walking through a Christmas market. The only thing missing is a cup of mulled wine :D\nThe scent immediately starts to take over the room. The sweetness is joined by a somewhat ""boozy"" note, but I can\'t quite put my finger on what it reminds me of. Rum? Apple cider? There\'s something synthetic behind it. Personally, I don\'t detect any myrrh or wood, but if I do, it\'s all suppressed or overwhelmed by this extreme cinnamon-sweet-alcohol combo.\n\nThe fragrance projects so extremely that it is almost somehow unpleasant. It is definitely difficult and somehow really, really heavy. The cinnamon/""booze"" note is definitely present throughout the entire fragrance and hardly gives the fragrance any air to ""breathe"".\n\nAll in all, the fragrance leaves me somewhat perplexed. It\'s not bad in itself and definitely something for winter, but it\'s not really mine. But if you like extremely sweet stuff, you\'ll probably like it.', ""I think Khamrah has some undeniable similarities to Kilian's Angels' Share, but if you're looking for a perfect dupe, you will be disappointed. In my opinion Khamrah is a very nice scent, but Angels' Share is still a bit warmer, rounder, and better.\n\nThey're closest in the beginning, because both start out with a very intense cinnamon note, warm vanilla and fruitiness. While Angels' Share doesn't have any fruit notes listed, it reminds me of dried apple slices. Khamrah on the other hand smells like the listed dates. They both give me a warm, wintery, cozy and snug feeling. And that's where the similarities end.\nIn the drydown, Khamrah doesn't get quite as warm and gourmand as Angels' Share. It's sweet, but it also has strong woodsy notes and a transparent booziness. I can also sense the praline and something vaguely floral, so it has a bit more of a designer perfume feel. The base reminds me a little bit of Kayali Invite Only Amber, it has a similar texture. I do like both of them, but this booziness is not 100% my thing.\n\nSorry for writing more of a comparison instead of a regular review, it's always hard not to do that when something is regarded as a dupe for a more famous fragrance that you also have a decant of.\nAnyways, I think Khamrah is a great choice if you're looking for a warming cinnamon scent and don't want to spend a fortune."", 'On really cold days, when you look at the thermometer and realize: ""oh, today I\'d better put on a thicker jacket"", this fragrance offers everything I need.\n\nSlightly sweetish alcohol note at the beginning, transforms relatively quickly into a pleasant cinnamon note.\n\nVanilla and a warm woody note accompany me in the further course of the fragrance.\n\nIn terms of durability:\n10-12 hours but quite easy (actually a madness for the price).\n\nSillage:\nMaybe next time only 3 sprays (you might smell it at the other end of the aisle).\n\nBut from the feedback, only positive responses.\n\nAn absolute blind-buy in terms of price-performance ratio.\n\nKind regards,\nPlain text', ""The nice thing is that I got it as an Angles Share alternative,\nWithout knowing exactly what Kilian smells like.\nI think the fragrance is mega good.\nI only read very often afterwards that it doesn't smell like the A.S.\nAnd there will be something to it, because the Khamrah definitely does not have an alcoholic note.\nIf you're looking for an Angles Share..... hands off.\nIf you're just looking for something similar that smells great and lasts a long time in winter....\nDefinitely a recommendation to buy.\nIn any case, I'm not sad about having bought it and it doesn't quite come close to Angles Share."", ""Since I've recently become a big fan of gourmand, sweet winter fragrances, and the khamra has been advertised by various perfume influencers as the absolute price-performance champion, I thought it would be interesting to get a sample from the souk. First of all: I know that Khamra is supposed to be a dupe of the Angel share by Kilian, but I have never smelled this fragrance before, so I will now evaluate it as a stand-alone release, regardless of its intention to be a fragrance twin.\n\nIf I had to describe Lattafa's Khamra in one word, it would be: Cinnamon bun. It smells like a warm cinnamon bun that has just come out of the oven. It has an extreme sweetness and the very pregnant cinnamon note extends beyond the opening, more or less over the entire wearing time of this perfume. Personally, I didn't notice much of the somewhat harsher notes listed in the base of the fragrance pyramid. However, as I quickly discovered, this is not for me. I find the sweetness of Khamra so overwhelming that I could hardly bear to wear it for a whole day. It's like real cinnamon buns, which I can only eat in very small doses haha. I can well imagine that people who like very sweet perfumes will find this fragrance extremely appealing, but I have to pass."", ""The perfume gives me full vibes of Kaiserschmarren, with apple mousse and cinnamon.\nAt the Christmas market, of course! Dreamlike fragrance.\nUnfortunately, the fragrance does not fill a room. Silage should be stronger for me.\nUsually the only flaw with Lattafa....\nBut maybe I'm an extreme (as far as the opinion of Silage is concerned)"", 'I´m going to be honest. I think the hype around this fragrance is more so a product of youtube influencers rather than actual merit.\nThis is incredibly synthetic and unnatural in a very very sweet headache inducing way. The main problem is that they compromise the balance of the scent with too much synthetic ingredients because they want to prioritize performance. For the price, I understand that it can be difficult to create a quality scent with good performance, but in my opinion, scent should always come first. To be fair, I´m not the biggest fan of the original AS, because that fragrance itself is quite synthetic and clearly overpriced for what it is.\nAnyways, if you are looking for true masterpieces in this genre that are worth the money I would point you to PDM Oajan or even XJ Naxos.\ndisclaimer:this review is not meant to offend anyone.', 'This fragrance is simply a stunner and bomb for 40€.\nA double whammy, so to speak.\nCardboard-sweet fragrance that surrounds a warm plum/date with vanilla and cinnamon. Somewhere there is still a little alcohol/rum.\nBut where is the bergamot?\nSo for 40€ actually a no-brainer if you like sweet-gourmandy Christmas market (because of this plum/date) scents!', 'Kharmrah is a very sweet and strong unisex fragrance. The packaging and bottle have a very high-quality design and are perfect as a gift.\nAs described above, the fragrance itself is very sweet and heavy, but therefore something for the cold season. It immediately evokes associations with the Christmas season and is reminiscent of the smell of baked apples in the best sense of the word, is sensual and gourmand and has something embracing about it.\nThe following applies to the amount of spray: less is more. In closed rooms 2 sprays are enough, if it goes out into the fresh air you can use one more. As I said, it is an intense and long-lasting fragrance.\n\nAll in all, Khamrah is an absolute no-brainer if you like sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially for the price.', ""At first glance, the Khamrah looks like an Angels' Share dupe.\n\nHowever, the opening of Khamrah is completely devoid of the alcoholic note that makes Angels' Share so special. Overall, the entire fragrance is characterized by a strong sweetness. This makes the fragrance rather one-dimensional, but the sweetness is admittedly also pleasantly heavy and sensual. It is not particularly synthetic either.\n\nThe fragrance is definitely something for the evening or for going out, perhaps also for a date. It needs cold temperatures, otherwise it would really be too much with its heavy sweetness. What's more, the Khamrah also has a feminine twist thanks to this very sweetness, although it is still grown-up.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are very good, especially for the price range in which the Khamrah is found. This also results in a pretty good price-performance ratio.\n\nEspecially for its price, I think you can both try this fragrance and buy it blind if you like very sweet scents."", ""Sugar Orient Bomb First of all, I have to say that I don't know Angels Share by Killian in real life. So I can only give limited information here as to whether Khamra is really Angels Share in Favorable. But let's take a look at this fragrance for ourselves first. The packaging is really great. A small display with mirror foil. In the price range 1a. The bottle is very..."", ""When I smelled the Khamra for the first time, I didn't like it right away, it has nothing to do with the Angels Share, for me it is much too sweet an almost pungent sweet so that it is unfortunately almost not wearable for me, durability and sillage are top for the price (as you know it from Lataffa), but the bottle is of weak quality, the lid broke after a few weeks. In conclusion, it has nothing to do with Angels Share and is too sweet for me."", ""I bought the perfume as a blind buy (I know....), but it was a complete success. The top note of the perfume is fruity, in my opinion it smells a bit like sweet (baked) apple, even though it's not in the fragrance pyramid. After a while, it develops into a pleasant vanilla scent. It definitely makes you feel like you're at a Christmas market. I can't say much about H/S yet, as I only got it about 1.5 hours ago and applied it for the first time. For the price, I wouldn't mind a less strong H/S, although according to the other reviews it should last quite a long time. Definitely a buy recommendation for the winter."", ""Omg where do I even begin?? This just smells like the most delicious, sweet yet spicy cinnamon and caramell dessert ever! I weirdly get cinnamon apple pie from this, though this doesn’t have any apple notes in it. I can definitely pick up on the sweetness from the date and vanilla as well as the spiciness from the cinnamon, nutmeg and myrrh. I actually also get a little bit of smokiness in the base, I'm guessing from that roasted tonka bean? It just smells absolutely addicting and super sexy to me with the spiciness and almost a bit leathery! Definitely nothing for the warmer months and also very strong! It literally lasts days if not weeks on my clothes and also has great projection! So, if you don't like sweet and spicy thiccc gourmand scents, stay far away from this one!"", ""Sweet and delicious. Smells of baked apple and Christmas cookies, which makes it very good for cozy winter evenings with the family.\n\nLongevity and sillage are very good, which is not unusual for sweet winter fragrances.\nPrice performance is okay.\n\nThe fragrance is not bad but also nothing special, which unfortunately does not live up to its hype (especially on TikTok).\nKamrah is also not a dupe of Angels Share and doesn't have much in common with it, as many like to claim.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking for a solid winter fragrance for cozy winter evenings, this fragrance is probably the right one for you.\nBut if you want a cheaper alternative to Angels Share, Kamrah is unfortunately not a good choice."", ""I was introduced to this perfume by my brother. He was surprised by the scent himself and had to show it to me. A very sweet, oriental and strong fragrance for fall or winter. It reminds me a lot of an oriental dessert called Künefe. Definitely a must-have for me for special occasions. I'll get it this year.\n\nAbout the fragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a sweet, oriental and cinnamon scent. The cinnamon scent then fades a little and then turns into a vanilla scent. The cinnamon scent clearly dominates. The fragrance reminds me of a dessert called Künefe. I'm sure some of you know this dessert.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a good, strong oriental perfume for special occasions in the fall or winter, you can't go wrong here. For just under 40 euros, you get a super sweet and strong oriental fragrance for fall and winter. Note: For me, the fragrance is strong, so I will wear it for special occasions. But it can also change. You get used to some fragrances.""]"

The scent is sweet-spicy. It is being marketed by LVMH.  ,['male'],"['Nathalie Lorson', 'Olivier Cresp']","['Sweet', 'Spicy', 'Powdery', 'Woody', 'Creamy']",['Italian bergamot'],"['Chestnut', 'Italian iris concrete', 'Benzoin Siam']","['Indonesian patchouli', 'Virginia cedar', 'Haitian vetiver']",8.3,7.9,7.6,8.1,7.9,"['I am lucky enough to be able to enjoy this perfume quite fast after its release and I can say that I smiling and keep sniffing my wrist all the time since I sprayed it this morning.\n\nIt starts very pleasant and familiar, with iris, bergamot and a slight boozy note .. the familiarity comes from the Florentine Iris present in DHP, which has a similar opening. This is for my nose almost identical with DIOR Homme Intense 2017, pre-reformulation version .. less powerful of course, but as intense and beautiful.\n\nThe chestnut and the benzoin, are shy and hide behind the multiple Iris notes but keep the character of the perfume quite romantic and classy. I do not smell any vetiver but there is a beautiful high quality cedar note in the dry down, making it even more classier if that can be possible.\n\nAfter about 20-30 min it becomes a very addictive smell (if you like LVMH Iris scents) which reminds me very much of DHP without the stinky leather, which to be honest it´s a total no go for me.\n\nThis is far from a ""new"" release, but very close to DIOR Homme I/P pre-Reformulation scent DNA. As we know, Givenchy and DIOR are both part of LVMH so for me this is a very smart move from them .. to take over the perfume world with DHP as the Original bad boy, and create a well behaved brother called Réserve Privée and make it a Givenchy.\n\nFor the price, quality and smell .. this is a 9/10 creation. 1 point goes off because it is a copy paste DHP without the leather.', 'Now this smells very nice indeed with the fresh iris in the opening that soon has chocolate facets. The whisky adds a nice subtle dimension to the scent and pairs well with the chocolate tinged Iris.\n\nAs time moves forward the scent becomes woody and nutty from the chestnut. Here it begins to get sweeter and powdery with what smells like a hint of caramel melded with the woods.\n\nI get several hour longevity on the skin and very average projection. Within arms length for the first hour dropping to within half a arms length after. It is a scent that stays close to you.\n\nAll in all a delight!', 'I thought about it for a long time. Should I really buy it? Do I really like it that much? Isn\'t it too sweet for me? And so I sniffed this fragrance again and again, pondered and then ultimately left it on the shelf. Until that one fateful Black Friday. It\'s the year 2023 and, like every year, I see lots of messages about various offers two days before ""Black Friday"". My inner anti-capitalist just wrinkles his nose. ""I\'m not going to take part"" I say to myself. Long story short: I bought it after all. On Black Friday. At full price. And I couldn\'t be happier about this decision. After this far too long intro, here\'s a brief summary of why I\'m so happy with this fragrance.\n\nFlacon:\n\nThe bottle is nice and heavy, slightly rounded as with every fragrance in the Gentleman range and fits well in the hand. I really love the color gradient of the glass from black to brown to transparent. For me, this color gradient makes it by far the most beautiful bottle in the whole range.\n\nFragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a very present whisky note, which actually reminds me of a nice glass on the couch in the evening. Despite the strong sweetness, the fragrance never becomes unpleasant or pungent, which for me is also due to the beautiful iris and chestnut. Both blend in very well and make the fragrance incredibly soft. In the drydown, it then loses some of its sweetness and becomes woodier without changing its basic orientation significantly. You could say the fragrance is linear. This is perhaps true in comparison to other fragrances, but this simplicity is incredibly fitting here in particular. It seems reduced to the essentials, calm, elegant, serene without the urge to really stand out.\n\nSillage:\n\nStriking is a good keyword. Because if you want to stand out, you can stop reading at this point and look for an alternative. Or keep reading and simply spray a little more. Joking aside, Réserve Privee really doesn\'t have a brute sillage. However, like its aforementioned simplicity, this is what makes it what it is: an incredibly sophisticated fragrance that you don\'t wear if you want to stand out, but rather if you know how to make your fragrance blend in perfectly with the rest of your appearance. If this fragrance were a person, it would be much more Ben Bernschneider than Andrew Tate and since I like the former much more than the latter, I can make this comparison with a clear conscience.\n\nDurability:\n\nThe shelf life of the Gentleman is probably the only point where I really have something to complain about. And even that is complaining at a high level. The fragrance lasts a reasonably long time, but I would still like a fragrance with this rather inconspicuous sillage to last a little longer, because after about 6-8 hours you can really only smell it very subtly. In my opinion, this also distinguishes it from similarly designed fragrances such as Dior Homme Intense (2011). While the latter can still be clearly smelled after 8-10 hours, the Gentleman is more or less just a nice memory at this point. It\'s not tragic, but that\'s also part of the truth.\n\nPrice:\nI don\'t need to say much about the price. For 50-60€, this is pretty much the finest fragrance you can imagine, so the price/performance ratio is almost unbeatable.\n\nConclusion/overall impression:\n\nThe fragrance does a hell of a lot right. If you are looking for an alternative to Dior Homme Intense (2011) with a nice alcohol note, you should definitely take a closer look at this one. For me, it is still a perfect fragrance for fall and milder winter days. Cozy, relaxed and yet classy. What a beautiful creation!', ""This fragrance. It's everything. Beautiful, sexy, dark, alluring, one would even say unisex (makeup purse vibe, maybe more swanky leather vibe from the iris) but don't let that deter you. This stuff is the best scent I've smelled in years. When you wear this, men will be jealous of you. Women will just make a face like you owe them something THEY NEED. This stuff is ALLURING, for sure. You want to make someone look your way? Look no further..."", 'Although I have now been moving for some time in the perfume community and already heard many tips and could gather experience on the subject, I let myself get carried away here to a blind buy. Fortunately, however, this was worth it.\n\nTouted on many channels as the ultimate fall fragrance, the fragrance caught my eye during a visit to a perfumery. Actually, I was determined to buy another fragrance. After this but on the day was not available, is the Gentlemen, influenced by the positive reports, after a short test on the fragrance strip bought.\n\nEnough preliminary skirmish, we come to the most important. How does the fragrance actually smell?\nIn the opening, the fragrance starts with beautiful, warm notes. I find despite the listed bergamot you can not really perceive citric notes. We have here a beautiful iris, which unfolds together with a chestnut note and underpinned by an alcoholic, Boozy note.\nThe chestnut I find very interesting and find that it fits well in the fragrance DNA.\nThe fragrance is rounded off with vetiver and patchouli.\n\nThe shelf life is with me at a good 6-7 hrs.\nThe sillage has enough power that your counterpart perceives the fragrance. But I do not find that it is too strong or almost already slaying.\n\nThe best time to wear the fragrance I see in the coming, cold season.\nHere he can score with his warm notes.\nThe best occasions for the Réserve Privée are dates or evenings with friends in a relaxed atmosphere.\nIn the office, the fragrance will certainly not tick off negatively, but I find for this there are better alternatives.\n\nThe rather dark design of the bottle fits well with the fragrance. Otherwise, the bottle is kept relatively simple. In gold lettering, the name and the Givenchy logo are held.\n\nPrice-wise, the fragrance is currently about 55€ for 60ml, which I think is absolutely reasonable.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThe many recommendations to this fragrance I can well understand. The combination of iris, chestnut and the whiskey note fits really well together. Just the whiskey lifts him again from other fragrances that also work with iris notes, I find.\nA test he is worth in any case and maybe he pulls even in one or the other collection.', 'Finally sampling one of the most recent releases from Givenchy, Gentleman Eau de Parfum Reserve Privee, that’s been understandably getting a lot of positive attention.

At first, it is strongly reminiscent of the original. As it progresses, it smells increasingly chocolaty and very sweet. A slight alcoholic whisky note resonates.

The baby cat plays on a velvet blanket and knocks over a small bowl of tonka beans.\n\nIn the opening, the fragrance smells sooo similar to Velvet Tonka , that I assure myself several times not to have grabbed the wrong AF. I actually have both fragrances :)\nConclusion: Opening 1:1 of the Velvet Tonka. The fragrance pyramids of the two fragrances are not 1:1 similar to each other.... now I\'m confused.\n\nTonka, vanilla, marzipan... sweet incense spice!\n\nIn the drydown, it becomes smokier and a bit peppery again. But somehow.... not essential. For me, the twin impression remains to the Velvet Tonka.\n\nIn the further development then comes marzipan. Beautiful. Also here. Nothing new.\n\nAfter 2 hours, it is still beautiful... and still Velvet Tonka.\n\nAlso the durability and sillage is good!\n\nConclusion: a fragrance twin. bdk is according to research appeared 1 year before ysl, consequently ysl has ""stibitzt"".\n\nBasically, I find it a bit of a shame that it is a fragrance twin - the special is somehow lost there.\nI like fragrances in the niche - and higher price segment, which are at most slightly similar, but at all times ""stand for themselves"". No copy.\n\nBoth fragrances it does not need at all, with a purchase I would still advise the 2 to test, since it is here about my very personal impression :)\nAnd then I would- personally take the Velvet Tonka, he was there first and ""deserves"" it in my eyes more to be considered.\nTo all who don\'t care, you can take the one that is the better deal. :)\n\nThe scent is as individual as this review is (not) - only the fact that I tested Velvet Tonka first makes the babycat a copycat for me. I could post the contents of the review to Velvet Tonka as well. Aaaaaber, he still gets its own review.\n\nIs a great autumn-winter fragrance, but there is already from BDK. Therefore, also something deduction in the fragrance rating', ""As someone already mentioned, it's just a full blast of incense. Peppery at the beginning, then comes the incense, and very darkly you can sense some saffron, and then vanilla, which tends to stay in the background. All of this with a very linear progression overall. Be sure to test the fragrance first!"", ""Babycat - what does that make me think of? A small furry creature with big eyes that finds it difficult to control itself. It rolls around and claws the handler's finger in play.\n\nBaby cats are cute! And that's why they can be forgiven for their other sides: they don't always wet the litter, they bite, they climb up your clothes and chew the skin of the person you're with. The watery nose and crusty eyes should not be missing from the list.\n\nTheir smell is not just pleasant either. In addition to the furry, delicate, baby-like cat smell, they bring a hint of cat food with them.\n\nIn this respect, I find the concept of YSL Babycat not entirely coherent. (Whether it would have needed a different name or a different content - it doesn't matter) The fragrance of the perfume is not ambivalent, not awkward, not babyish, not animalistic, not playful. You can smell a consistently pleasing, slightly masculine, vanilla scent.\n\nBut here in detail: the vanilla is always present, but does not play to the fore. It is roughened with pepper and cedar, resulting in a very harmonious interplay. The strong sweetness finds an interesting balance with the hard incense after the top notes have faded. In the end, it is just sweet-gourmand.\n\nI can very well understand the association with melted rubber that someone described. But that's a bit of a mean assessment. Because the intensity of this olfactory impression does not drift off into the unpleasant or synthetic.\n\nPersonally, I'm not so fond of the vanillin note and the very sweetness. The performance of the Babycat struck me as positive and I also liked the development. It's not my taste, but if you like vanilla, you'll like this one.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say anything about price performance, as I'm not familiar with this price segment. An alternative might be the Prada Luna Rossa, which is much cheaper, but in my opinion not much worse.\n\nConditional recommendation - if you like vanilla and don't mind the money."", ""Over 600 fragrance reviews for a fragrance that hasn't been on the market that long and isn't available in every perfumery around the corner? You could really call that hype. One that I honestly can't understand. There are much better and more sophisticated vanilla fragrances, even in combination with incense. Lune Féline EAU DE PARFUM comes to mind spontaneously - without incense, but in a similar vein. Also somewhat similar is Leder 6 by Schwarzlose. I don't want to denigrate the fragrance, but I think that alongside many very positive reviews, there should also be room for a somewhat more neutral opinion.\n\nNow to the fragrance: I would have expected a complex, multi-layered fragrance with a progression. One with a clear sillage, mysterious, heavy and noble.\nWhat I got: Incense, leather and vanilla. No more, no less. No great development, seems a bit cobbled together to me. I'm not a big fan of incense in perfume anyway, if I want incense, I go to the... The vanilla is quite pleasant and somewhat reminiscent of Guerlain vanilla. But the rest of the ingredients don't make it any better.\nI secretly wonder where the baby cat is supposed to be hidden - I suspect it's hiding behind the last pew.\nToo bad, but: Not my business!"", 'Babycat - Misjudged and spurned for over a year because the test card was thrown away too early\n\nI couldn\'t understand the hype at all. Saint Laurent or not (I am a couture dressmaker myself and an admirer of ""Yves"", or rather his style and the ideas behind it). And I certainly don\'t wear a perfume called ""Babycat"" (even though I don\'t have a cat myself). I found the perfume terrible. Headache potential to boot...\n\nBut because of the never-ending hype, I had to try it again this winter, since the release - this time ""properly"", spraying the card properly, in the middle of the living room, leaving it for 24 hours, virtually ""holding out""...\n\nThe first 30 minutes LOTS of incense and a tiny bit of leather. Since I don\'t really know what to do with the church and leather is not my scent at all, even with a lot of ""sweetness"" and ""vanilla"", it\'s usually nothing for me. It\'s also extremely intense - it was just too much of a ""bad thing"" for me and the fragrance was far too overwhelming - but if you give it enough time, after about 30 minutes there\'s a huge turnaround that I\'ve never experienced before: Then it becomes the longer the more incredibly delicious, sweet smoky vanilla! And a little later, a ""burnt plastic"" note is added - I love that!\nSounds incredibly simple, but it\'s not\n\nAnd lasts and lasts... Easily 2 days\n\nAnd now: I really don\'t want to go through the cool season without it!\nActually, I\'ve always said: Make sure you get a sample, especially at such prices, let the fragrance develop fully for 2-4 hours and let it work its magic for 1-2 days - then buy it (or not)\n\nThe whole ""Le Vestiaire"" collection is a dream and looks high quality, whether you like it or not, definitely worth a smell festival!\nTo make up for it, here is my first, very, very honest review.

In the dry down, the fragrance develops more and more depth and becomes a bit spicier and even develops a slight woodiness for me. In short, really nice! But for me, it\'s just not worth the money.... According to my nose, it is simply the nobler, more complex and deeper Bleu de Chanel.

(Now I have an almost full one)\n\nWhy did I regret it?\n\nI really liked the consistent and different way. Because he doesn\'t just keep it short with 1,2,3 citrusy notes and with 1,2 flowers like most do (some better and some less good) , but he takes a different approach.\n\nThe second (interesting) back story:\n\nI have heard it this way (several times, let me correct it if it is wrong), the oligarch was no longer allowed to be called oligarch because of the Russia - Ukraine conflict and therefore due to certain ""ambiguities"", therefore he was hired and in his place came the Isola Blu, which was (noticeably) adapted - but more about that later!\nWhat is the old Oligarch (perfume) actually like?\nAt the end of the day, it\'s enough to say citrusy, slightly metallic and insanely complex, but that alone doesn\'t do it justice. We have here a good portion of fresh and fruity citrus in an XXL portion (and that is not an understatement) in a high-quality, beautiful, noble and NOT synthetic vein.\n\nAfter that comes my ""LOVE PHASE"", then something quite crazy happens, the citrus bomb becomes a Reflection Man many, many years ago - in 2015/ 2016 they said something like clean, metallic cold and almost sterile (but in beautiful!) and combination makes it a real masterpiece - so much for the impression and the realization!\n\nThe comparison!\n\nThe back story is well known, now to the Isola Blu. In the course of the adjustment and adaptation according to IFRA, it felt completely renewed and much was replaced and much is now noticeably on a synthetic basis. That doesn\'t have to be a bad thing - certainly not, with an extremely good tuning it can be very good. I don\'t want to (!) say that Roja Dove has done it wrong, but the Isola Blu has a somewhat.... on the one hand, they went the entry-level friendly route and the synthetic notes in the Isola Blu are not mine!\nSo if you do, then use an old Oligarch as a perfume and NOT Isola Blu. A comparison almost borders on an oligarch insult^^.\n\nHow is it received:\n\nMy old oligarch back then as well as my current oligarch from 2021 (one of the last!) are really incredibly well received. Whether women or men in the age range of 20, 40 or 60+, all of them love it!\nWhen and where to wear it?\n\nYes, I could now say office and yes that would definitely fit, but it really always goes and always fits (no matter what season or occasion), if there is still enough of it in the formula as a perfume I would get 10 bottles!

Or at least a few of them. When I looked at the fragrance pyramids, I kept thinking about what these perfumes must smell like if they have so many different ingredients.\n\nWith ""Isola Blu (perfume) / Oligarch (perfume) | Roja Parfums"", I now know what it smells like. I wanted to try it once before. Back then it was still called Oligarch. The name was quickly replaced. But then I couldn\'t find it again. I probably didn\'t look hard enough. In the meantime, I forgot that I wanted to try this fragrance. But now the time had come.\nThe Isola Blu PARFUM begins with a very fine, not at all pungent, but tangy and fruity citrus. This citrus is the reason why I also find that the fragrance smells a little fruity. In between, it is a little soapy and spicy, but just right. However, it is very multi-layered and becomes a little heavier and also a little sweet as it progresses. Frankly speaking, however, it is extremely difficult to recognize certain fragrance notes. You might think that this fragrance is almost perfectly blended when you think about how many different ingredients are listed here. And you don\'t get the feeling that any two components are clashing and don\'t smell right, nor do you get the feeling that it\'s all too much of a good thing. Because the fragrance is not overpowering. It is still pleasantly gentle.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that it has little power. Its longevity and sillage are very good for a fresh, citrusy fragrance. It wears well in spring and summer, preferably on a man. I also find that it can be worn almost regardless of the occasion. I could even imagine wearing a delicate spritz of it to the gym, if my already expensive little bottle wasn\'t too expensive for that. The only thing that speaks against ordering this fragrance immediately is its really high price.\n\nBut it is an absolutely first-class fragrance. You should have smelled Isola Blu PARFUM at some point.', 'Isola Blu is a typical Roja fragrance with many scents.\nHere too, however, the overall picture is good.\nIt doesn\'t overwhelm, but simply fits together well.\nWith Isola Blu, we naturally get a fragrance that is perfect for spring or summer.\nCitrus-fresh impressions, pleasantly spicy & greenish.\n\nThe fragrance features lime as the main player in the top note.\nA perceived mixture of lime juice and lime zest.\nThere is also some bergamot and lemon.\n\nOver time, a very subtle ""sweetness"" is added. Furthermore, floral notes add a certain depth and fit perfectly into the overall picture.\nThere is also a slightly soapy impression, as well as a greenish vibe and a great matching spiciness.\n\nTowards the end, pleasant woody impressions are added.\n\nMany people always claim to get associations with toilet cleaner and co.\nI can really only begin to understand that.\n\nAll in all, this is a Roja that I really like a lot.\nIn summer it\'s just ""awesome"".', 'Oligarch is a fragrance for a true oligarch, who spends summer vacations on his yacht in the most enchanting locations overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.\nFresh, citrusy, crisp and aromatic.\nAs in all Roja creations, it is difficult to separate the various notes that compose them, but I can say that juniper, citrus and pink pepper are well perceived.\nThe woody structure holds all the volatile components very well, providing truly remarkable longevity for the type of fragrance.\nDespite not being a lover of the genre, I must say that I like it very much: it is fresh, clean, but at the same time has depth.\n\n14 Swarovski cap, engravings and gold plate.\n\nPPS: Oligarch was discontinued due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and was put back on the market under the name of ""Isola Blu""...

F** mania of the brands in loading their current perfumes with this stinging note.\n\nWhat do we get out of it?

Generally on summer evenings, when you are walking through the city or near a shore, while you look into the eyes of the love of your life and plan the future with her...\n\nThis was the last perfume I gave my girlfriend before she left me for someone else a few days later.\n\nI still have this perfume in my nose to this day and every time I smell it, I always think it was her who walked past.', 'I used to wear a lot of Prada, but in recent years I haven\'t worn anything apart from the Infusion range. So I was all the more excited about Paradoxe. There is also an Intense version. created in 2022 by Nadège Le Garlantezec, Antoine Maisondieu and Shyamala Maisondieu.\nAfter the first spray, bam déjà vu. After a quick look at the notes, confirmation => very similar to Amarige by Givency. Same vibe and since Amarige was released in 1991, you don\'t have to think twice about who copied from whom. The retro vibe seems to be in demand at the moment, for nostalgic reasons I recently bought Amarige again after more than 20 years, I don\'t need two almost identical fragrances, especially as I find Amarige\'s bottle more beautiful. There is also a little Shalimar. Or Armani My Way. Or Born in Roma. You see, no groundbreaking innovation here.\nNot a shy fragrance either, an intense, gourmand fall and winter fragrance for women over 30. An initially fruity, then beguiling, floral fragrance.\nGourmand in the drydown, but not too heavy or overwhelming.\nDefinitely a woman\'s fragrance. You have to like jasmine and vanilla. Juicy sweet fruits and flowers; a suitable companion for the romantic cuddle time, some festive decadence, cold and wet outside and warm punch and dimmed lights inside. Vanilla, ambergris and jasmine cannot be denied a certain commercial character. This fragrance is by no means an office or travel fragrance and can trigger migraines. The sillage is above average and so is the longevity.\nFeminine, floral, powdery, sweet and intense.\nFor many, the fragrance will evoke ""I\'ve smelled it before"", it is not unique or one-of-a-kind, which would have been the case if pear had been made more prominent. You have to be very careful and not overdose here. I would have liked to have smelled old Paradoxe from 1983 by Pierre Cardin, it is supposed to be chypre-like and floral with pepper and moss.\nParadoxe 2022 is by no means shy, discreet or suitable for the office. Mainstream going out fragrance.\nIf I hadn\'t bought Amarige, Paradoxe would be a candidate for purchase.', '...carefree, sweet and free!\nLike summer 99 - Paradoxe smells young and cheerful without being childish.\nWhite creamy blossoms with a citrusy freshness are the prelude, one immediately thinks of a warm summer breeze full of spices. The air is hot and shimmering.\nOrange blossom takes vanilla by the hand and makes a silk bed in the cornfield, feeling good without getting tired.\nThis fragrance puts you in a good mood, lasts like a bomb, has a delicate floral sillage and gives you that certain something, like a thin summer dress that caresses me in the August wind.', ""it's the same with prada paradoxe.\n\nit has a similar dna as many many other perfumes, but honestly iss the hammer.\nsame and yet so wonderfully different.\n\nif i'm honest, i love this perfume. it's the only sweet perfume that i'm allowed to wear without my mother beating me to the ground because of its obtrusiveness.\nif i'm honest, i just can't understand the hate for this. it smells good and belongs to the mainstream, probably that's what bothers the fine baccarat rouge idolizing perfume critics nose of some users here probably.\n\nit's inexplicable, but the scent just smells like sexiness to me. like emily strawberry when she's out of puberty lol. well, definitely fitting for this target group (to which i count myself as an almost twenty year old)\n\nas a not-so-long former smoker, i must also admit that the perfume mixes well with cigarette scent. i can't explain it exactly, but it's just really really delicious.\n\nwhat exactly is paradoxical about it? well, no idea, I'm still trying to figure out.\nprobably the fact that the scent is so incredibly horny and cheap at the same time.\nand I do not mean cheap in the sense of money.\n\nit is simply a perfume that balances on the thin line between sexiness and trashiness on high heels, but that's what makes it. on such I stand now times with perfumes, my friend thank god also.\n\nin any case, the perfume is definitely a compliment catcher and perfect for going out."", 'I love this fragrance.

That's what happened to me with THD Eau Givree. My father had ordered the fragrance as a blind buy and couldn't really do anything with it. He then gave it to me so that I could sell it on. It sat around for a few weeks until I actually had it in my hand and wanted to take the pictures for the souk. Only then did I test it out. I could never do anything with either of the other two THD versions; for me, both fragrances have an earthy note that I don't like at all. After spraying on the Eau Givree, I was more than surprised. The earthy notes are not part of this fragrance, and in general there is hardly any similarity to the other two versions. After seeing the pyramid, I quickly realized that I would keep the fragrance myself.\n\nThis flanker is an insane fragrance from spring to fall, much more invigorating and fresher than the original.\nThey stayed true to themselves with the pepper, which I would consider very similar to the EDT version, only here they used significantly more.\nThe Eau Givree starts with a very intense lemon citrus, juicy, slightly tart and reminiscent of fruit pulp. Somewhat cool and almost so intensely citrusy that it could also be reminiscent of a grapefruit, for me it also has a certain similarity to lemonade. After the first few minutes, however, you can clearly recognize the lemon, which also has a somewhat tingling effect. I can also detect juniper, but at the beginning it is clearly in the background of the lemon and pepper. I already like this combination of notes in other fragrances, and smelling it on its own is also very much to my taste. As the fragrance progresses, it becomes more bitter and slightly dark green and spicy due to the juniper. The lemon remains recognizable until the base.\n\nIn my opinion, it is only slightly similar to Isola Blu PARFUM in terms of the pepper and juniper. The citrus in the Roja fragrance cannot be compared with this one, not that one of the two is better, it's just not similar for me. Since I recognize other notes such as thyme, some lavender, champaca and oakmoss in the Isola blue, the two are slightly similar for me, but still different enough to have both in the collection.\n\nA fragrance in the simple and good category. While other fragrances only depict their top notes, Hermes manages to dedicate an entire fragrance to them, which is why the progression is very linear. Sometimes that's just enough. I don't need to say any more, it's relatively easy to assess whether you should try it. If you like the notes, then go ahead and test it."", ""I came across this beautiful fragrance rather by chance when a good friend bought a bottle and he was so enthusiastic about it that I was allowed to fill 10ml to test it myself, because he said... i know you, you'll like it.\n\nI tested it for the first time on a wonderfully warm but not too hot summer's day in August.\nShowered in the morning, got ready for the day, sprayed it on (a brave 4 -5 sprays on the neck and nape, without knowing how it would perform)\n\nand my first thought was..... WOW, am I in a lemon garden on Lake Garda or on a walk in Sicily, the land of lemons.\nThis wonderfully citrusy freshness that immediately casts a spell over you and makes you dream of a vacation in Sicily It is never too intrusive, but still present.\nIn the drydown, you get the juniper berry in the background and it becomes a little spicier for me.\nThe longevity is perfectly fine for a citrusy and fresh fragrance.\nA fragrance that can be worn from spring to late summer and in my opinion it belongs there, hence the title, SUMMER IN THE FLACON\n\nI can recommend it without reservation and I advise everyone to try it!"", ""Many thanks to Carsten for the bottling of Terre d'Hermès Eau Givrée :-) I have to say that this is a very simple fragrance that can be described as a lemon bomber. I like the scent very much, my best friend found it rather solid and my mother quite bad. That's how opinions differ. Unfortunately, it only lasts around 5 to 6 hours on my skin and the sillage is similarly subdued.\n\nI don't even need to come up with top, heart and base notes here, as there are really only 2 aromas that stand out. Logically, there is the lemon, which is as intense as lemon juice and lemon peel cannot naturally achieve. It smells incredibly intense, fresh but also somewhat synthetic. Some citrus cleansers even come to mind, although the Terre d'Hermès Eau Givrée smells good in this respect. Apart from that, there are also juniper berries that remind me of gin.\n\nThis is a really nice, fresh and citrusy summer fragrance. However, I have to ask myself whether it's worth buying a bottle of it. In my experience, you don't really stand out with it, but it shouldn't bother anyone either."", ""what a beautiful new discovery...i came across the scent by chance and tested it immediately and bought it soon after. wow...what a beautiful, citrusy freshness. extremely long-lasting on me. i'm curious to see how it comes on in summer. kind of reminds me of the louis vuitton fragrances, afternoon swim, imagination etc...! price/performance is certainly better here though ;-) unfortunately my wife doesn't like it at all, so it's probably a polarizing fragrance...but for me it was love at first spray....the top note is bombastic! so my absolute test recommendation for fresh summer fragrances!"", 'The departure is a cool blend of sulfur, juniper, pepper and mineral citrus; like Terre meets Pamplelune on the rocks, but once that exquisite tang fades out the rest is not so impressive.\n\nIt develops a sticky side - like a Jardins’ drydown, then moves through a long period of viscid freshness; until finally, a woody-aromatic vetiver appears in the base.\n\nThe opening is the best grapefruit ever, but the longevity given by the musky ‘citrus’ is just marking time in my opinion. Personally, I would have preferred something more like an Eau de Cologne that fades cleanly - so you can respray and enjoy the bracing head notes, but ‘never mind the quality, feel the width’ is the rule these days.\n\nBeing a flanker in the style of the Jardin series, this doesn’t say anything new; except Nagel’s new style may be morphing into a flanker of Ellena’s old one.', '…with an added grapefruit/citrus RUSH.

From French, Eau Givrée translates into English as frosted water and it is superlatively cold. I love the punchy citron in the head notes along with the juniper.

However, you would expect this from the price, because it is quite something. You have to put a few green bills on the table for this fragrance. It is supposed to be special, almost complex. But is it really?\n\nFirst things first: the fragrance is wonderfully creamy, cuddly, with a hint of ""sweet darkness"" tonka bean, which sinks deeply sensual into a warm sea of jasmine, while gentle cinnamon flakes and rich fruity notes melt into the whole, as if they were just waiting to combine with other components. A crystal-clear wind blows, which only brings a few icicles and creaky spices with it over time. A muffled depth full of tobacco and warm accents soon opens up. Here the angels sing O thou dark one, instead of O thou merry one. Snowflakes drift in your mind, it crackles in the fireplace. Tobacco becomes much stronger over time and has a beautiful relationship with jasmine. Tonka bean is always emphasized, which produces one of the most beautiful sweet scents I have ever smelled. You sink into the fragrance as if it were made of fluffy black clouds. Rounded off with a hint of high-quality alcohol & some tuberose, which is really velvety here and in no way shrill, as is so often the case.\n\nA very fine specimen, but for a few euros less, it would be absolutely passable in all respects! The price is not justified. Other houses can also do this well, but for much less. I now have it at home as a sharing bottle and that\'s ok, but paying for the fragrance alone is quite a hole in the budget. So be it! If it hits you in the heart, you\'ll get it, but it\'s not enough for the 10 for me. It\'s a beauty, perfect for winter, with a subtle, sinister and absolutely brilliant sweet touch, but in my eyes there\'s more to it!\n\nDurability and sillage are in the upper range, not to mention the bottle.\nBeautiful deep dark black, with red/gold accents. Heavy in the hand.\nAlso looks good on the shelf.', 'Hello everyone,\n\ni have unbelievably thought for a very long time about whether I should write a review (at all).\n\nOf course it\'s about the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" !\nBefore I come to the ("") most important things, which will probably interest most people, I would like to say something about the bottle, the sprayer, the lid and the box! You can think what you want about the company (as with everyone), but you have to admit one thing - the bottles (with the lid) are an eye-catcher and as far as this point is concerned I can only give them a true (!) 10 out of 10. I really can\'t help anyone who gives this an 8 or lower. We are noticeably and visibly in the absolute high-end range here...\n\nBut now...\n\nOverrated?\n\nYes, yes - the video by Marc Eggers and Marc Gebauer have already decently boosted the hype!\n\nDo you need it?\n\nWe are talking about the high-end niche sector in general and the wheel was not reinvented with this fragrance and you can clearly recognize the signature here in my opinion + there are certain parallels to other fragrances in this respect (more on this later). ALSO... - not mandatory, certainly not, but you should know it (my opinion) !\n\nAre you worth it?\n\nIt really is a tiresome topic, because on the one hand -\n\nnow to the point about the ""dear price"", I\'ll put it this way if we say we have a certain desire for luxury products / fragrance products in the niche sector then I find it difficult or quite honestly almost pointless to chalk this up as something negative. Nobody is forcing us to spend this money. If you ask me now: Benny is it worth it? Then I say, if you want to spend it, test it and then buy it, but I recommend everyone to test it! You just have to experience it - the art of what is / can be possible.\n\nAnd on the other hand -\n\nwe are here in the range of 10€ per ml (depending on the offer or sometimes even more), so in my opinion it is already relatively normal to ask yourself - cost - benefit factor, is it for example 9x better than a designer fragrance and can you still recommend something like this with a clear conscience...?\nI find this very difficult...!\nWhat does it smell like?\n\nFragrances by Clive are usually very complex with great development and co. but this one is a little different. For the first 15 seconds, you get everything that characterizes the fragrance AND it\'s also very linear. Yes, 1, 2 things become more or less, that\'s normal - my opinion!\nSee fragrance notes (above) and except for the jasmine (fortunately not too noticeable) I notice all of them, but very prominent are the tonka bean, tobacco and amber. This is a really very difficult combination that can very quickly lead to headaches or nausea (if the composition is wrong), but the implementation here is very good and I really like it!\nSimilarity to: There is the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" always some moments where it reminds me of well-known fragrances - ""XJ 1861 Naxos | XerJoff"" (tobacco, tonka bean, jasmine) , Herod (smoky - sweet + the characteristic less sillage and good performance = after 4h skin scent), some Carlisle (this dark - smoky and sweet) , the Amber Star from the grooooben fragrance direction ( max. 10%) and the magical + mystical and the style and fine tuning of the ""AddictiveArts - Jump Up and Kiss Me Hedonistic | Clive Christian"" !\nHow is it received?\n\nLike my two (2017\'s) Herod + Carlisle very well..., sometimes even my wife wishes I would NOT (!) use it because it goes down so well with the opposite sex.\n\nPerformance:\n\nThe better I think is fair... and you can boost it excellently in terms of performance with, for example, Molecule 01, Herod ..., but now my absolute SECRET, take 4x the ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" and 3x the ""AddictiveArts - Jump Up and Kiss Me Hedonistic | Clive Christian"" my favorite combination since mid-October.\n\nIf I wasn\'t really convinced, I wouldn\'t recommend it to you! (You can test it once, but buy a bottle.... - if you like it like me then yes)\n\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', ""Whether the thing is worth 550 euros or not, everyone can judge for themselves. I think it is, because I haven't smelled anything like it before and no other fragrance has ever inspired me so much.\n\nThere was a gale-force headwind from all directions because Marc Gebauer presented it in his YouTube room and all perfume connoisseurs naturally wanted to shoot against it. It's partly understandable - because everyone wants to justify through precise research and years of experience why this or that, which the niche-affine general public likes, is actually not that great...and whether the ingredients justify the luxury price? Logical! Just like you can buy anoraks for 1500 euros. All justified by the quality.\nIf anyone has a perfectly fitting alternative for a smaller price, please let me know anyway ;)\n\nThe only thing I can say about the fragrance is that it makes me stop constantly as I walk straight ahead to let the cloud of scent pass me by, which I then inhale with relish. Alternatively, my wrist wanders towards nostril 1 and 2 every minute.\nI could wear Blonde Amber all the time, even if it tends to be more of a cooler season and evening scent. There are insanely strong, image-generating reviews of the fragrance's progression, pyramid, etc. here, to which I can only refer.\n\nAnyway, I have the third bottling of the fragrance and I have to promise myself that it was the last. I have to get the bottle so that I have peace. At least for now, until the bottom of the bottle separates us."", 'First of all, I would like to ask you not to drive me through the village if I do not completely celebrate ""Noble XXI: Art Deco - Blonde Amber | Clive Christian"" and also take a critical look at the composition here and there. Nevertheless - for the record - this is a good fragrance.\n\nIn my eyes, it would be an even better fragrance if it could maintain the magic of the opening. Here I can only say, WOW, a 10/10. This really does pass for an aphrodisiac. It smells like I\'m popping 5 fruit gums in my mouth at once, a real explosion! Floral, fruity, sweet, seductive, erotic - simply amazing!\n\nUnfortunately, Blonde Amber cannot maintain this magic in my eyes. Because after only about 5 minutes, the tobacco noticeably asserts itself. Many people celebrate this and I can understand why. The tobacco gives the fragrance corners and edges, a certain wickedness and yes, also character. In my eyes, however, it takes away this ""light"" and erotically seductive quality. Don\'t get me wrong, the fragrance remains interesting, it\'s just that I find the characteristic develops a bit pungent in my nose. I think it\'s a shame that it loses its lightness and that ""special something"" of its opening. It develops more arbitrarily for me. Yes, the fruits remain and so does the sweetness, but they scream more for attention, according to the motto: ""here I am, notice me"". The fragrance reveals its intention and thus loses its mystique. That\'s cool in the club! You\'re sure to stand out there and if you\'ve decided to spend the night in other people\'s beds, you might even manage it.\n\nPersonally, I miss the elegance, the style, that something less ""obvious"". So I think you definitely have to be the type of man/woman for this fragrance. For me, this is an extroverted fragrance that doesn\'t hold back, that is loud and reveals its intention. If you can identify with this fragrance characteristic, go for it! The fragrance will not disappoint, even for the price. For everyone else who is a little more reserved, who is looking for something that smells seductive but is less offensive, yes, I would advise against this fragrance.\n\nSomehow this may sound contradictory, but I\'ll summarize it again in a nutshell. The fragrance DNA is great, it has rough edges, captivates with ambery notes, a seductive sweetness and a smoky, noble tobacco. For me personally, however, it is too ""puffy"", too deliberate. But maybe I\'m just not the type for such a loud fragrance. For the price, however, I would have hoped for that ""certain something"" more.\n\nPS: I might buy a bottle and spray it on in the club. As mentioned above, I think it works best there.', 'This perfume is just rightly experiencing hype in the niche world.\n\nMy personal association with this incredible perfume is a well-dressed gentleman. Suit by Tom Ford and the Blonde Amber as a good smelling companion.\nWho comes to mind, James Bond in the movie Skyfall, place Shanghai.\n\nThere are countless amber fragrances, but this one has the crown on not without reason.', 'I am now testing the fragrance as I have ordered a leftover bottle.

For me, perfection as far as a great warming autumn scent is concerned. It's just so cozy and I still love it today. Also the durability is really satisfying. From the performance you do not need an extrait. Many laymen think such flankers and in this case the extrait version is just more performance. This is often not the case, as there are already differences in fragrances. This fragrance is also somewhat different from its original, but this great basic DNA is always perceptible.\nWho knows the original can order this fragrance without risk blind. The RRP is a little too high with 245€, but you get it already significantly cheaper. Described in a nutshell, one can summarize: Initially stronger sillage, darker fragrance DNA, possibly also a bit more masculine than the soft original. I like darker versions of lighter fragrances, as is also the case with Prada L'Homme and Prada L'Homme Intense. Especially in the dark such fragrances come very well, have something mysterious.\n\nThe packaging is great. Matching the dark fragrance DNA this comes in great black cardboard where all fragrance notes are listed again. This brand has style. Also the uniform flacons can convince and these atomizers are already world class.\nWhen dividing the strength of the notes was played around a bit: The cardamom note in the opening is much much stronger than that in the EdP, but the fig note is very dimmed down and the black tea is also slightly weaker. Here, especially the cardamom fans get their money's worth. The top note is extremely long present and the heart note goes down slightly, which is not too bad. The 5 base notes, on the other hand, are very present and the dark patchouli kicks in very early and provides a slightly darker DNA. The sweetness from the tonka and bourbon vanilla is not sticky and provides a soft and sweet vibe in the background. Also this beautiful sandalwood note is very pleasant as in the original and is for me in combination with the other notes already perfection. The fragrance is already very cuddly, cuddly and simply also very interesting and balanced.\nThe performance is slightly better than the original. Especially the opening is already beastmode. The Extrait is already a perfect fragrance for evening. Intense and also the fragrance aura is very appealing for the late hours of the day. Sillage is the first 2-3 hours very room-filling, then becomes very pleasant.\n\nOn the whole for me a draw between the EdP and the Extrait. Both have their advantages and I like to have both in my collection. Who has not so much or wants to spend: Lattafa has with Liam a clone, which I will also still test. Overall a great extrait, which is simply worth the price. Especially for men and ladies who like dark fragrances a great upgrade."", '06. February 2023, a normal day at the office so far. It\'s quite cold outside and I\'m the last to leave.\nI get into the car and realize that something is wrong with my right eye. It no longer closes when I blink. My girlfriend is studying medicine, so I sent her a short recording of it. Alarm! Off to the hospital. This could be a sign of a stroke. After hours of waiting, the examination and the result. Peripheral facial nerve palsy.\n\nI had to stay there overnight and undergo a lumbar puncture the next day. I\'d better not go into what that means here.\n\nWhen I got up in hospital the next morning, I couldn\'t believe it: the non-functioning closure of the eyelid when I blinked turned into complete paralysis of the right side of my face. Mouth, nose, eyes, forehead. I simply couldn\'t move anything, what a feeling!\n\nBy this time, I was totally in a perfume flash. Thank goodness I was well looked after at home by my girlfriend & browsed through all the possible sharing\'s here on Parfumo every day.\n\nAmong other things, I had ordered 10ml of Gris Charnel EXTRAIT and the fragrance finally arrived. I carefully sprayed it on my forearm and smelled it directly, at least with one nostril. This moment will never be lost to me again.\n\nI couldn\'t describe it, but this fragrance hit my synapses so hard that I immediately felt a sense of hope and strength. I called my girlfriend and told her to smell it too. For her it was just a ""yeah, it smells okay"". Please what? Like just ""okay?"" That\'s the scent!!!\n\nOver this long period, more and more bottlings and samples arrived. I tried everything each time, full of anticipation, but none of them were like this perfume for me at the time.\n\nEvery morning after my ""facial training"", I went to my little bottling rack, picked up this atomizer and smelled it. Each time, I was overcome with a kind of warmth and serenity.\n\nThe soft fig, together with that teen note and the slightly spicy punch just completely hit me. It\'s still one of my favorite fragrances & I wonder why I don\'t have a bottle yet. The last remnants of the bottling are being treasured like a baby.\n\nPS: The bottling is now empty & I treated myself to a bottle :)', 'At first I just wanted to write a short statement, until I realized that the words available to me were not enough. It would certainly have made sense to sit down for 15 minutes and think about how I could summarize what I wanted to say in short words. But then I sniffed my arm again.\n\nThis fragrance deserves a few more words.\n\nBy the way, Gris Charnel means, as far as I can tell, figuratively ""the sensuality of gray"". ""Gris"" is gray and ""Charnel"" can also be translated as physical and carnal in addition to sensual. And when I think about it, that fits quite well. A gray embodiment in the form of the bottle, with an inner sensuality.\n\nI get the same impression when I apply Gris Charnel EXTRAIT. It is only wonderful for a short time at first. Really only the first few seconds, when the veil of fragrance rises briefly from the skin after application and gives you a little foretaste. A taste of its true potential. Of the depth it actually possesses.\n\nAnd then...\n\nHe is gone. Suddenly. The wonderful scent of soft, almost powdery, slightly fruity, creamy and green freshness is gone.\n\nI then notice something that I can\'t understand. It smells herbaceous. Smoky. Green. I searched for it a few times in the other reviews to be able to understand it. This spicy note must be the vetiver. Plus the teen notes on top?\nI have no idea what it is. But what I smell is really unexpected and almost magical. And it also makes me sad. How can such a wonderful fragrance turn into this spice monster in a matter of seconds?\n\nAt this point, I kept smelling my arm and trying to waft the scent up my nose. To no avail. The smell remained. Too bad, I thought. So a short statement.\n\nNo sooner said than done. Sat down, opened Parfumo, Gris Charnel Extrait, statement. What can I say, ah, good at first, then smoky, strange, not my cup of tea.\nAnd here... we\'re back to the beginning of this review.\n\nI smelled my arm again to be able to describe it better.\n\nThen I thought for a moment that I had gone mad and could conjure up Gris Charnel Extrait. Where has the smoky, spicy scent just gone? It can\'t have been more than 30 minutes ago that I noticed this change in the smokiness on my arm. How can it be gone now, almost as quickly as it came?\n\nWhat I smelled then reminded me again of that first breeze that came into my nose from the scent. But somehow more mature now. More grown up. More serious. But also deeper and ultimately more sensual.\n\nNow I\'m sitting here smelling my arm again. But not because I don\'t want to admit it, like when I turned into the spice monster.\n\nBut because I can\'t believe how good it smells.\n\nI can\'t say anything about longevity and sillage, I\'ll leave that to others.\n\nBut so much for my feelings and the magical transformation of the fragrance. For me, it is pure art and what I enjoy about fragrances. Complexity and transformation.\n\nIt\'s gris outside, by the way. But what I smell on my arm is indescribably Charnel.', ""I had the opportunity to test this fragrance I was so excited it was one of the most beautiful moments for me at the beginning something smoky but after a while the scent develops so beautifully, black tea vanilla a scent that I can not really describe it has something sweet and at the same time something smoky. So at the moment it's really my favorite"", 'It was in the spring of this year when I was allowed to smell this fragrance for the first time. Through quite a few recommendations and reviews that have highly praised the fragrance, my expectations rose exponentially with. Arriving in Berlin to visit my sister as well as other friends, I ended up in KaDeWe one day. An attentive and friendly employee introduced me to new perfume releases. When she held the bottle of ""Gris Charnel Extrait"" in front of my nose, I had to smile.\n\nI knew at the same moment, when the fragrance molecules of the Extrait\'s have been captured by my sense of smell, which fragrance I will already wear in the fall. Most of all, I would not have wanted to wait. The Gris Charnel Extrait gives me a similar feel-good effect as the Dior Homme Parfum, but the tonka bean and bourbon vanilla give the fragrance a sweet ravishing depth. While creations such as Wūlóng Chá EXTRAIT DE PARFUM project a fresh note of tea and fig, the black tea and fig appear in the Gris Charnel Extrait, in creamy symbiosis.\n\nThe durability is excellent, so that after the morning application to skin and clothing, I could still register the Extrait until late in the evening. The sillage is good and in my opinion tuned to perfection, as the fragrance follows the wearer rather than leaving traces in the wind.', 'The Gris Charnel EXTRAIT has been massively hyped over the last few months, and not without reason; the scent has a really unique and beautiful fragrance DNA that is close to a chai latte.

It's been on my wish list for a long time. Alongside Rehab and Musk Therapy, I now have the complete white line in my collection. Each of these series is worthwhile. Musk Therapy is a bit different, Rehab and Paragon go in a similar direction.\nI love white fragrances. Clean, neat fragrances that do justice to this radiant white bottle. Initio creates this twist of cleanliness and sex appeal with this white line. Simply one of my favorite brands in the niche with which you can't go wrong in my opinion and blindbuys are not as dangerous as some other brands. Just extremely pleasing without being too 0815.\n\nParagon was only moderately successful at first. At least in contrast to the other Initios. It still hovers somewhat under the radar, but also has some fans. You should always form your own opinion as tastes differ. I think this Paragon is simply brilliant, similar to the Rehab. Roughly speaking, these two go in a similar direction.\nIt's definitely worth the money if you look for a good price on the internet. It's also worth the RRP of €250, but you can get it for less than €180. The packaging and the bottle are quite something and you get nice clean vibes with seductive accents on high quality.\n\nAs I said, this Paragon goes roughly in this Rehab direction. If you liked the Rehab, you should definitely try this one. It is by no means a twin, but this clean DNA with this seductive sweetness is also very present. The two also share this beautiful lavender opening. Sage and plum have also been added, which already has a very unique touch and stands out from the mainstream. The fragrance is never too heavy despite this pyramid. On the contrary: this sage-lavender freshness is convincing and is accompanied by plum and a pleasant sweet-woody note. Sandalwood is added in the base, which is already very present in the drydown. I hardly notice any or almost no oud, which doesn't bother me. All in all, a fragrance that convinces me 100% and is simply totally interesting and unique. It's already a new love for me. There are also plenty of ways to wear it. Almost always: all year round and for all occasions. Also 100% unisex for me, similar to the Rehab.\nPerformance is outstanding for a fresher, cleaner fragrance. Double digits with a pleasant and good sillage. Perfect and satisfying.\n\nAll in all, a perfect purchase for me that I will enjoy and would buy again. It's definitely worth a test."", ""Bergamot/lavender in the head ... it's wonderful how the fragrance then picks up the support of PaloSanto and black pepper, carried by the sweetness of plum - and then the so-called healing oils of sandalwood and oud. I currently know of no better perfume for dealing with trauma! It's amazing how the limbic system reacts, how this fragrance is able to provide calm as well as stimulation. My new favorite fragrance!"", ""To the Paragon has already been said a lot. For my understanding, I would also need to say nothing more, because only when you read the great reviews of the Parfumos here, you can start to understand this fragrance.\nNamely, that this fragrance can not be comprehended.\nI feel an admiration when I read here how strongly different and especially things, how many, sometimes absolutely mutual, notes are smelled in this fragrance.\nBut I want to put my opinion to appreciate this fragrance because I got to know him through a small tester. After that, I got me at least 3 fillings of 10 ml each, to buy in the end but still the bottle.\nThe Paragon is actually the first fragrance that I bought after the many testing as a flacon. I love him...\n\nThe fragrance started for me fruity-creamy, which fruit does not open up to me. A particular note I can not smell out, a lavender hint I receive through my nose. Yes, lavender is listed here, in fact I know only since then that I like lavender in fragrances. I have this fragrance to thank for this discovery. But do not worry for lavender muffle: I mean, hardly anyone smells this note out but this creaminess is already only for those who like it creamed.\n\nI also do not like oud fragrances so much: the more I was shocked that oud is listed here. I absolutely do not perceive him. For this the sandalwood base, which dances and creams on my skin on and on for a very long time.... I wouldn't describe it with Nivea or Body Lotion vibes, the fruitiness is very present for that and not soapy enough at all. No, for me it does not smell like a creamy body lotion, its creaminess is unique and unique for me...\n\nThe scent is rather quiet and mysterious, yet decidedly present and not at the same time.... He blows himself even me over the nose if he has any desire at all, as if he had a life and will of his own. and that 3 days later still.... To at least with me the durability is unbeatable for such a quiet fragrance.\n\nVery elegant and noble, my husband likes the fragrance, by the way, also like, and that wants already, with his difficult attitude to niches and their prices, what is called.\n\nThis fragrance does not want to please but challenge. I see him to a self-confident woman who knows how to dress and move and no longer feels the need to be pigeonholed by social constraints. A woman, therefore, who has chosen inner freedom as a way of life.\n\nNo blind purchase candidate but definitely worth a tester. Maybe discovers the one or the other here, accompanied by the Paragon, also his way to freedom\n\nBest regards\nChristianne"", 'First of all, I bought the Paragon blind.\n\nWhen he perceived the fragrance the first time at the spray head I knew immediately that I will like it and exactly that was confirmed after the first time on the skin test also.\n\nThe fragrance is wonderfully light and smells 1to1 like my body lotion only just with a shot of plum.\n\nMentally, he has somehow moved me as the very first to a warm summer evening at the lake with a glass of wine to it.\n\nThe fragrance is quite present, however, it would surprise me if someone perceives this as disturbing, because the fragrance smells like a body lotion as described at the beginning.\n\nThe durability has my expectations with 7-8 hours on my skin also really excited.\n\nTime of day and occasion are to wear this fragrance really completely indifferent.\n\nConclusion: A really successful fragrance that always goes for my sensation!', ""Initio is a familiar number to everyone in the fragrance world, but the Paragon is somehow lost in Initio. Is it really much worse than Oud for Greatness , Side Effect , Rehab or Musk Therapy ? Nah, absolutely not, at least from my point of view! The newcomer to the house, however, has somehow just not yet found the connection and hype experienced, but that's not too bad.\n\nLet's skip to the fragrance:\n\n- It's a fresh-fruity-tart plum-sage scent that's so special, it's hard to describe simply. Although it is fresh-fruity-tart, it is also sweet. Really very special!\n\n- In the prelude, a plum-sage combination is immediately perceptible, which lasts through the entire course of the fragrance and goes with it into the drydown. Together with the lavender, the fragrance acts at the beginning still fresh, but becomes increasingly sweet in the Drydown!\n\n- After that, the fragrance goes into an oud-sandalwood base, although it must be mentioned that absolutely no animalic oud is present, rather a slightly sweet oud, which makes the fragrance become increasingly sweet in the drydown, but still retains the relaxing sage-plum combo.\n\n- Durability is really surprisingly good, the sillage upper midfield; but surprisingly good performance, especially in the first hour the fragrance radiates really well\n\nA real hidden champion, but definitely needs to be tested, especially since the sage-plum combo is not the typical combo and also the playing along of oud in the combo is not always a guarantee for a crowd pleaser.\n\nDefinitely worth the try!"", 'Initio has dedicated a small series of fragrances to hedonism - or hedonists: Musk Therapy, Rehab and Paragon. The white flacons are probably intended to convey joie de vivre, pleasure and joy and to indicate visually that no pain or suffering is to be expected from these creations.

Is it a ripe purple plum that is tipsy?...', 'I was a little surprised by the Paragon from the very first second. I actually have direct associations with chewing gum, for whatever reason.

And that's because it immediately reminds me of one of my very favorite but already discontinued fragrance. I don't understand why I haven't read anything about it here yet. If I had, I would have gotten it much sooner. Unless I'm the only one who smells it. But I immediately think of Jil by Jil Sander. Gives me the same vibe.

It is a FLANKER, not a debut scent. It wasn’t claiming to be anything “different”. It is very similar to the OG, but it’s got it’s own personality. I love the drydown.\n\nIt’s also being called “weak” and being knocked down for “poor performance” but I get a projection bubble of about 2-3ft with a sillage that LINGERS nicely, and leads the noses directly to the wearer, and the longevity is a nice 6-8+ hours easily.\n\nAgain, if you want something “revolutionary” or “innovating” it isn’t going to be what you’re asking, but it by no means is a “soft” as people have been saying, nor does it “die off” as quickly.\n\nIs it worth $160 for 125ml?

Overall, it is an alluring scent.\n\nWhile not a fragrance that shouts from the rooftops, Code Parfum consistently reminds you of its confident but unobtrusive presence. It lasts at least eight hours on me and I spray only half as much as I do with other fragrances to achieve the same potency. I think this unassuming all-purpose expertly-crafted Code has been overlooked and maligned by those expecting it to be a loud heavy powerhouse.', 'This is a great flanker, more mature and not as sweet as most of the other Codes. Iris is the new fad, so this is Armani’s intro to it. This is a great all around scent and can be a signature scent as well. Great performance, but not a beast and that’s a good thing. I’ve been wearing Code since it came out. My favorites are EDP, Absolu and now I’ve added Parfum to the list. I can say almost anytime I wear any of the aforementioned I get complements.

Slightly fruity and tinglingly sweet and spicy. Shortly afterwards, the suede hits and lingers for a long time. A dark, authentic leather that I like better than Tuscan or Ombre leather. Less scratchy and penetrating, but wonderfully soft and much gentler. The incense immediately follows. It becomes darker and darker, spicier, more masculine, but never oppressive or intrusive. After around 4 hours, it becomes softer and softer; the vanilla slowly emerges and pushes the leather-incense mix into the background.\n\nThe fragrance is complex, but never wants to take center stage. Mysterious, spicy, deep. A real everyday all-rounder with that certain something for men.\n\nIf you like Ombre Nomade, Tuscan leather or widian London, but don't fancy a fragrance that polarizes and has to fill an entire room, this is the perfect fragrance for you\nExtremely successful all round."", 'How to start. I have been dealing with fragrances for a long time. Leathery scents are among my favorites and therefore I am always looking for new treasures.\nWhich I always liked, but the price was often too much for me: Widian London. The probably next to Tuscan Leather best-known leather fragrance.\nYou can say all 3 scents go in the same direction.\nBut now comes the but: The Kinetic Sillage makes some different. You smell the DNA and you also notice the leather. But it is not really in the foreground. For me, the raspberry and creamy notes dominate. The fragrance is so beautifully soft and creamy and super to wear in everyday life. But also has that certain extra to wear it as a special fragrance for great occasions.\n\nFor me, it takes the notes from the London and reinforces those that are easy to like and those that are not easy to like move into the background.\n\nSillage and durability are very similar to the London. Who is looking for something very unusual and extravagant should rather reach for the London.\nI, however, wanted a fragrance that brings compliments, is easy to like and where the P / L ratio fits.\nThat is the case here! For the price on 100ml he hangs for me the London and the TL by lengths.\nThe bottle is noble and feels very high quality.\nAnd he comes for me from one of the best perfumers in the world. Many great works come from his hand so also this.\nSo who likes leather and fruity notes, please test this fragrance!', ""Widian London has rightly joined the bestseller list of niche perfumes, as its leather-raspberry combo is simply irresistibly fine/beautiful, yes, finer than Tuscan Leather!\nAfter a while, there were more and more discussions about possible weaker batches, or fruity/leathery etc... You might think that the London has changed or been changed over time, I can't say whether that's true or not, but personally the new batches seem a little weaker and leatherier to me than the older ones. And that's exactly what I miss, that beautiful, fruity raspberry note that set the fragrance apart from the TL and made it more unique/sensual, more refined, because, as already mentioned, the new batches have been toned down in this respect. Nevertheless, I compared both fragrances (Sillage and London) at the same time on the back of my hand and the result was amazing. The price of London is also astonishing at just under 260 euros for 50ml, whereas Sillage costs just 190 euros for 100ml, which is definitely something to consider! First of all, both fragrances smell extremely similar, only the nuances as well as the durability and projection are different\nI won't go into detail about the fragrance, I think that should already be clear and obvious. I will merely point out the differences.\n\nI can't adequately comment on the quality either, as I'm not very familiar with the specific ingredients (apart from oud), but I'll still rate my feelings and the composition!\nFragrance/subtle: To put it succinctly, the sillage is more fruity, less leathery and that's exactly what makes it better/subtler/sensual, more beautiful and more pleasant for me! In plain language: Sillage is fruitier due to the more present raspberry!\nLongevity and projection: An important characteristic of a perfume, especially in this price range, but it must also be specifically mentioned here that especially the durability and projection is different for each skin and factors such as temperature, weather, daily form etc. are relevant to be able to judge at all, so I refer this to my own personal experience! Sillage surprised me, as this fragrance was always longer and more intense than London. Where London was almost gone, I could still hear the sillage, especially the raspberry-vanilla note, it was melting! Do you have an intimate date in the evening? Then spray it on in the morning and in the evening you have an extra booster for the pleasure of two - basically! Specifically: Sillage radiates longer and stronger than London! Both lasted more than 10 hours, yet sillage with much stronger projection from 3 hours onwards!\n\nConclusion: Why the hell should I spend almost 260 euros for 50ml when I have a fragrance for 190 euros 100ml that is far better for me! The only argument would be a nicer box, nicer/better bottle and more leathery character - not mine!\n\nPS: The sillage is almost 1 to 1 with the older batches from London!\nConclusion: Sillage is one of my favorites, not an Artisan, not a specialty, but it doesn't always have to be! I feel very comfortable with this fragrance and it stays with me all day - that's enough for me.\n\nPS: I deliberately leave out obsolete complimentary arguments because they are pointless and trivial!"", ""Don't get me wrong I love the London and it's rightly at the top of the list of best fragrances but this isn't about it, it's about its little brother if you can call it that!\nThe sillage of Kinetic perfums!\nThese two fragrances could not be more similar and yet they are so different.\nIt's just a little lighter, comes across a little more fruity and seems to me like a version in which everything has been changed that could be disturbing about London!\n\nAfter spraying it on for the first time, you are met with a light leather note that couldn't be more elegant without exception, and then the raspberry joins in, making the whole thing sweeter and fruitier.\nIt is by no means artificial or pungent, but blends in very well.\nThe oud gives the whole thing a certain depth and warmth and makes the whole thing seem continuously special and gives a feeling of luxury.\n\nFor me personally, the better choice for London and a little insider tip! The price is also a real bargain.\nSure, it doesn't come close to the bottle, but that's not the point, I would describe it as solid but by no means special, but the atomizer is absolutely top.\nI smell it all day long and when I put on my coat the next day, I immediately notice this warm and luxurious fragrance.\nIt comes across particularly well on cool and rainy days.\nSo as you have been able to read so far, for me simply a 10/10"", ""I think this fragrance manages to convey exactly what it is trying to say. For me personally, it evokes one thing above all, a nice evening with friends while wearing a leather jacket and the scent of the fruity raspberry cocktail wafting into my nose.\n\nThis fragrance manages to make leather and raspberry dance with each other beautifully. These two notes really stand out, in a positive way. It does for me (I'm sorry for the comparison, because the other work is also great) what the London doesn't do for me. The smell of leather is not overpowering. The fragrance becomes slightly creamier for me over time, which I really like, while the London becomes stronger and stronger in its leather note. This difference is enough for me to indulge in this fragrance. On that note, unpack your leather jackets people! Hasta La Vista!"", ""I went to Brückner in Munich without expecting much. I asked about the sillage, received top advice and was presented with similar fragrances. But let's stay with Kinetic. As soon as I sprayed it on, it was clear -> OK, this is going to be something.

Throughout, it has a citric quality that I cannot categorize in the lemon universe as either lemon zest or lemon juice - possibly something in between. This ""something"" is flattered by the tonka bean, which makes the fragrance a pleasantly warm citrus scent for me!', ""First of all, don't worry, the fragrance won't leave you smelling like an oversweet and walking coke bottle all day!\n\nI have to say that I've already tried a few fragrances by now, of course, I'm certainly not a pro when it comes to sniffing, but I have to say that I've never smelled anything so cool and unique.\n\nWith Tonka Cola everything is just right! The first sharpener is definitely cola, cherry cola, cherry cola with a tiny slice of lemon.\n\nAfter a little time, I no longer find the cherry so strong. The whole thing has given way to the tonka bean, which now proudly presents its splendor. In tow is a hint of cola and a delicious pinch of cinnamon. In combination mega good! The nutmeg (I can definitely smell it) makes it the perfect blend.\n\nH/S is completely fine. No beast mode of 10-12 hours but easily 6 hours at the start.\n\nClearly a unique, successful fragrance."", 'Mancera is without a doubt one of my favorite brands. Again and again you can find here quite unusual combinations, mostly underpinned with a typical synthetic, which you can find so in my opinion only at Mancera. My nose smells fragrances of this house quickly out, perhaps also because I like the basic Machart.\n\nWith Tonka Cola was immediately piqued my interest and what can I say, the implementation is quite successful, as long as you only pay attention to the first third of the scent.\n\nThe start is characterized by some citrus, a lot of cinnamon and a clear cola note, very exciting!\nCinnamon you should definitely like, because as we all know, this spice rarely lets loose. Also here, in any case omnipresent.\n\nIn the course, however, this Mancera develops much more to the disadvantage, so at least my opinion.\nThis is mainly responsible labdanum and benzoin.\nAlthough the cola-cinnamon mixture remains present, but then joins a sweetish, clearly perceptible resin note in addition to a blasmanic note.\nWith both things I have so my problems. There are very few fragrances in this category, which I like.\n\nHere is aggravated by the fact that the combination of cinnamon and cola with labdanum simply does not harmonize. It makes the fragrance seem much less modern. Without meaning it disrespectfully, I then always have the association towards an older lady.\nThis is per se not equally bad, but can not be reconciled with my preferences.\n\nFor me, the fragrance is not wearable in the long run, it becomes annoying and typical of Mancera is also that it is anything but quiet. He reaches a Red Tobacco or comparable not the water, yet he projects quite neatly. A good endurance is also given.\n\nConclusion: super exciting start, unfavorable course, for me difficult to wear.\nThe base could have been designed much more suitable.', ""I already wrote a statement about this fragrance a while ago, but it simply deserves a more detailed review. So, here we go. :-)\n\nI got to know this fragrance through a sharing, after I noticed it several times here and although I couldn't do much with the fragrance description, I was still quite curious. I didn't necessarily expect it to be a fragrance for me. Do I really want to smell like cola? I think cherry is great, but citrus scents are always a bit of a problem for me, just like cinnamon... Hmmm...\nWhen the fragrance arrived, I sprayed it on straight away and was immediately in love with it. I've never smelled anything like it before: definitely cola, but not as blatantly sweet as I had feared, and clearly lemon, just like in Lemon Coke. There's also a little bit of cherry, but it's quite in the background. Nutmeg and cinnamon are not clearly recognizable for me, which is quite good in my case ;-)\nIn the dry down, the fragrance becomes softer and the lemon recedes into the background, where it combines with the vanilla. Tonka comes through very clearly. Surprisingly, this harmonizes perfectly with the cola.\n\nFor me, the fragrance is suitable for all kinds of occasions and at any time of year. In summer, it's better not to overdo it with the dosage, as it could be a little too much. I also wear the fragrance in the office and so far my colleagues have only had positive things to say about it.\n\nA really very special fragrance that not everyone will like. Obviously mainly men here at Parfumo. I think Tonka Cola is really unisex and can be worn by everyone. I've since ordered a bottle of the next one - I can't afford to run out of this fragrance."", '""Tonka Cola | Mancera flashed me from the first moment and is now one of my favorite fragrances. The fragrance has a nice citrusy opening, which I really like, even though I don\'t like citrusy fragrances.\n\nAfter about 15-20 minutes, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla take over, leaving a Christmassy scent throughout I can\'t really perceive cola and cherry, if anything you get a very slight whiff of a freshly poured cola in a glass with lemon.\n\nI think the H/S is definitely better than 8/10, especially the sillage is clearly noticeable. As soon as you enter a room, you notice the cinnamon vanilla nutmeg mixture.\nThe fragrance can definitely be used daily in the fall/winter season without being too intrusive, here the dose makes the poison.\n\nWhat also convinced me is the quality of Mancera and the bottle, especially the magnetic closure makes everything more valuable.\n\nAll in all, for me a very good fragrance that differs from others and is something new for me personally.', 'After spraying, cola, cherry and cinnamon first appear. After a while, the cola and cherry note fades, while then the vanilla stands out more and the cinnamon note still remains. A fragrance that I have never smelled so.

But now to how it comes across to me. After spraying it on, you can clearly smell a glass of cola with lots of lemon. For me, more lemon than cola.

What's more, as is typical of Mancera, you get great value for money here. Tonka Cola smells peculiar and that is not meant negatively, but it is simply peculiar in its way.

It comes across too quickly as a cheap cleaning agent. Here, this assessment was correct again.\n\nNew York is the theme and I think of skyscrapers, busy back alleys, crime scenes, Broadway shows, expensive housing, a whole lot of people, crowded tour buses and mass transit and so much more. And what do I get with this composition? The little kid standing in Central Park for a little while, lost in thought, blowing bubbles until the little can is empty. And I really mean that, because after less than an hour there's nothing left. Nothing at all. And apart from soapy notes in the form of aldehydes, lily of the valley and a few other white flowers, I didn't even notice them at a projection of less than five centimetres. A waxy woody note lingers a little longer, but only minutes pass before it is covered by the scent of the skin.\n\nThat's a bad joke at almost two euros per milliliter.\nWhat does this have to do with New York?"", 'A really great fragrance.\n\nIt is as fresh and clear as the sky. The floral fragrance is accompanied by musk.\n\nAt the beginning, there is a clear, fresh, citrusy scent, which is probably created by bergamot.

I dunno guys, but all I get is a traditional approach to Lily-of-the-valley. Kind of soapy and slightly reminding me of home sprays. Jasmin adds a bit of fluffiness, but not enough to take away that sharp cleansing product vibe.\n\nThis is closer to grandmother Diorissimo (1956) EAU DE TOILETTE than it should be.

In the opening more the ginger and the base then more the vanilla, as it is shown in the pyramid. Unfortunately, the ginger in the top note smells so strong on the skin as if I bite into a ginger and taste it or it reminds me of it. This is very very unpleasant for my nose.

It was a great scent, don’t get me wrong, but being in the southern USA, that thickness was very unforgiving. The best analogy I can think of is a melting hard candy… that’s the vibe it gives once the temperature hits a certain point.\n\nThis one though, still brings the sweetness, but it doesn’t feel as unrelenting. There’s a smokiness that alleviates the sweetness, and makes it more bearable. It’s got more of a smoky/boozy feeling sweetness to it. The Parfum lives up to the “magnum gun cylinder” more so in this sense as well, as a “bad boy” is more likely to have a “smoky” vibe than a “sticky” one used when people describe his “swagger”.\n\nThe performance is also great, projecting nicely, and leaving a direct sillage trail that points to where the cowboy has been, and who it is that is leaving that magnificent trail behind. Longevity is a good 8 hours, with the last 3-4 hours being present, but closer to the skin.\n\nThe EDP and the Parfum are very similar in scent, but the differences ARE indeed noticeable enough. Would everyone want both? Probably not. Would I buy one if I had the other? Not if I weren’t the cologne collecting madman that I am today.\n\nIt’s all about what it IS that you’re looking for; The EDP (2021) release is a great nighttime scent, with a very thick, very sticky, very sweet feeling to it. The Parfum (2022) is still sweet, but slightly more versatile (although I wouldn’t call it a daytime scent), and has a smokiness to it that sort of “lightens” the sweetness, which now has a “boozy” feel to it. Grab a couple of testers, and choose your poison.', 'The scent is reminiscent of Christmas, the Christmas market and mulled wine At the beginning it is very spicy, just its ginger direction. Over time, it transforms into a wonderful vanilla scent.\nIt lasts 8-12 hours, sillage and projection are above average.\nI can recommend this fragrance to anyone who wants to smell like Christmas!', ""I've had the perfume for a year now and it still impresses me how good the quality of azzaro the most wanted is.

The scent bubble feels almost porous. It’s there, but very thin and almost “misty” feeling. It projects to about 3ft for maybe 2 hours, and then it comes very close to the skin. The sillage trail is also light. It definitely doesn’t leave the traditional “Acqua Di Gio” sillage that sits and lingers forever for everyone to marvel at. The longevity is moderate.

Grade to the current temperatures a great alternative, so I bought this. It was also absolutely worth it. It was love from the start, especially since I also like the original Noir Extreme EAU DE PARFUM very much. Can I absolutely recommend, even people who already own this original.\nThe perfume series seems quite good with this Noir Extreme Parfum . Black Orchid Parfum and Costa Azzurra Parfum . Well done with these great gold plated flacons. Makes already curious and looks very noble. This Noir Extreme Parfum I found already the most interesting. For fans of this original already a must-try.\n\nThe original Noir Extreme EAU DE PARFUM I own for a long time. Determined already well over 5 years. At the time I bought me the 50ml, which is now probably still filled with around 40ml. Especially by the Kulfi for me a masterpiece, which, however, you can not so in everyday life. It smells to me like a fragrance for special occasions, without if and but. Maximum to the evening an option.\nMy expectations for this perfume were high, especially because of the reactions in the statements. What I was looking for and expected? Absolutely. This ""half blind buy"" was worth it. For me, the more portable version, which is clearly reminiscent of the original. Even without Kulfi!\nThis time I chose the 100ml, especially since I like to wear sweet-spicy scents in the fall / winter times in everyday life. The 100ml are worthwhile with this definitely, because this can already make addicted and you can not sattriechen. Compliment factor is certainly also high. In the RRP, this fragrance is very expensive. I think this is at 230€, to have this is around the 140€. The latter is this absolutely worth it because of this quality and the overall package.\nPackaging is not so special with Tom Ford. A simple cardboard box, here in beautiful gold like the bottle. Must also not be so decadent in my opinion. The bottle, however, is very pretty and looks classy.\nWhich one is better? A question that you often get with flankers. Can not say here. In everyday life and versatility I like this much better, for the wow effect would possibly be the original better by this concise Kulfi note.\n\nAs I said, even without Kulfi being listed, you can recognize the original right away. This is not a flanker that stands out completely from the original. Here, however, was turned in the right places. You get a much spicier scent. Cardamom comes through well, but also a great vanilla note, which you can wear well outside of prime time. Amber and nice woody notes follow. This vanilla amber is really pleasant. Combined with spice and great woody notes. According to the pyramid, it\'s guaiac, cedar and sandalwood. Very pleasing and addictive. The drydown is soft-woody and sweet and a great finish to a great fragrance.\nPerformance is good, but not necessarily better than the EdP. Pretty much on a par. Sillage is pretty strong the first few hours, but in a pleasant sense. Durability should be between 10-12 hours, which is absolutely sufficient and perfect.\n\nFor me, on the whole, the perfect variant of this role model: very similar, but just a bit classier and more versatile. Am happy to own this fragrance in 100ml. Will be the next few years a gladly worn fragrance.', ""I have now had the opportunity to test both versions. The Noir Extreme perfume offers a warm spiciness that is perfect for cold days in fall and winter. Compared to the original, I personally miss this sweetness and I don't find the fragrance to be as long-lasting.\nNevertheless, it smells great and you can't go wrong with it.\nEveryone has to decide for themselves whether the price is reasonable. As a big fan of Stronger with you intensely, there are cheaper alternatives for me personally that also have the sweetness that I find lacking."", ""Tom Ford Noir Extreme is my third Tom Ford and as a winter and fall fragrance it's perfect for the cold season.\nThe sandalwood and tonka bean form a good base note and give the fragrance a nice depth.\nAs I said, I would only wear the fragrance on colder days, otherwise it could even be perceived as too strong.\nThe only criticism I have is the ginger note after spraying, which has a bitter aftertaste and is somehow out of place as a whole.\nNevertheless, Tom Ford Noir Extreme is a very successful perfume for winter and thick cotton sweaters."", 'I\'m not normally a big fan of heavy, sweet and creamy fragrances from this league. But when I bought Lost Cherry, my better half took me a sample of Noir Extreme Parfum, so I had to try it out.\n\nThe first time I sprayed it on, my nose wrinkled up - full-on campfire smoke that reminded me of Ombre Nomade (= not good at all, I think Ombre Nomade smells awful). After about 30 minutes, however, this unpleasant smokiness is completely gone and the fragrance settles down with a light sweetness, noble creaminess and beautiful vanilla notes, which is perfect for dark and wet fall days and is not too intrusive even in the office if you dose well.\n\nLong story short:\nThe fragrance has swept away any skepticism and is absorbed. Incidentally, I almost reached for ""Noir Extreme"" (without ""Parfum""), which smells noticeably different. Fortunately, I tried it again on a paper strip so that I noticed it. So make sure you pick the right bottle. Incidentally, this is also the only flaw in the fragrance and seems a little cheap compared to the ""Private Blend"" fragrances.', 'The original Tom Ford Noir turned into an air freshener for me on the dry down which put me right off. TF Noir Extreme EDP was a lot better but I thought the fruity, Gourmand like effect was a bit powdery and not very dark. This one…. This hits just right.

I know I will go back to this again and again.', ""I'm not convinced that I can tell how this is wholly different from the EDP. I know I am know I am not thinking that I would be disappointed if I had requested this but had been bought the EDP instead. Its the same with Ombre Leather.

This one starts off with a smokiness ,which if you make the mistake of smelling it close up you initially think what the hell No!

Because my first impression is often of bathroom cleaner rather than Amalfi Coast.\n\nBut not with City of Stars. While I was waiting in the LV store and browsing through the perfumes, this beautiful bottle caught my eye. The scent notes were still roughly in my head. ""That\'s not for me"" I thought, but a pink and purple bottle? That\'s definitely something for me. So I sprayed it on. Wow. Delicious. Not that typical biting citrus smell I\'m used to. It\'s a fresh blood orange with floral tiare. The other citrus fruits also come to the fore, especially the lime. But these are accompanied by sandalwood and musk, which makes this fragrance smell wonderfully soft and creamy.

Do I write creamy too often? Perhaps.\n\nFor me, the scent feels like I imagine a drive along Sunset Boulevard or Highway 1.

And that really is a great feeling.\n\nOf course, the price/performance ratio varies depending on the user. I think this fragrance is actually too expensive because, in my opinion, you have to spray it again or need one or two more spritzes for it to develop properly and not immediately disappear into the general scent of the body.\n\nAll in all, I find this fragrance very well-rounded and really great for the summer.', ""Out of this new LV unisex collection this one leans the most feminine. This smells sexy and luxurious. This smells sweet and creamy with the citrus notes complimenting it. The type of scent you want to smell like when you're on a luxurious summer vacation.

It's not going to envelope you with a heavy cloud you'll smell on yourself all day like an MFK Oud Extrait, but you'll get wafts of this for a few hours (4-5), it's lighter.\n\nI don't get the performance everyone else claims, on my skin it's loud for 3 hours, then I get a little bit here and there 4-5 hours into it. Anything after 5-6 hours it's completely gone.\n\nVery unique scent, never come across anything quite like this.\n\nThe presentation is almost great, the box the bottle comes in is great. My only problems are that the gold plate on the front, the snake portion is extremely thin plastic that feels like it will fall off, and then the cap...the melted paint is just plastic.

It smells very tropical and exotic, you can smell a lot of fruity notes and especially the mango stands out. The durability and sillage of this fragrance are above average.

It also goes down very well with others and is a compliment to others', 'Just recently picked this up after seeing some hype about it and people saying it is the Erba Pura killer. And well I have to say I agree. I have never been a fan of Erba Pura and never understood the hype behind it, to me it smells super syntethic and just too much.\nGod of Fire on the other hand is just the perfect Balance between the tropical fruits and freshness, it does not smell syntethic at all and you can really smell the well made ingredients here. This will be my go-to this summer along with Pacific Chill. Very unisex fragrance that might be feminine leaning, but this on a guy during the summer will be a MAGNET.', ""This fragrance has been the talk of the town for a long while. The mango note had me very curious as I'm in a phase of loving sweet tropical notes in perfumes. Also, I finally got my hands on Lamar, another fruity tropical scent, and I feel very satiated by having it, but when the opportunity came, I just couldn't miss it, because a mango fragrance is very appealing to me.\nGod of Fire opens with a note of unripe mango. It is tart, fresh, not too sweet and it is quite green. Soon after, a light, shy sweetness appears and the fragrance is very appealing, especially with the sunshine outside. I cannot help but compare it to Lamar and the two are very different, in such a way that Lamar is sweet, sensual and mouthwatering. God of Fire, however, is a fresh and uplifting scent. The mango is still quite tart, the lemon uplifts the fragrance even more and the sweet, grounding notes haven't made their entrance yet.\nAfter dry down, I find the mango note quite elusive and I'm unsure whether it's still there or if it's just a memory... Mango Skin from Vilhelm Parfumerie is still fresh in my mind, I have to say that I prefer MS. God of Fire is nice, don't get me wrong, but it is just that, not much else. I find myself completely satiated by Lamar at the moment and God knows I have enough fresh citrus scents in my collection! God of Fire falls short of what I expected. Reviews made me believe it would be the most mouthwatering mango, dripping with juice from the ripe fruit. I was lead to believe that the scent would be absolutely addicting, but I am left feeling underwhelmed. After just an hour, I have trouble detecting the scent, let alone the mango note. I reapplied liberally and find myself comparing God of Fire to scents from The Body Shop or Yves Rocher, both being simple and likeable in their own way, but not mind-blowing or mesmerising.\n\nLuckily, or maybe not, time will tell, I bought two samples of God of Fire, because I was sure it would be amazing. Maybe this is a scent I have to wear a couple of times before I start loving it (like Hibiscus Mahajád), but I am quite sure that the scent has just been overhyped and now suffers the consequences."", 'I started hearing about this and I saw the reviews and read the chatter about this fragrance just before the hype started to gather towards a head-long sprint.

The scent is sweet-oriental. The longevity is above-average. The production was apparently discontinued.,['unisex'],[''],"['Sweet', 'Oriental', 'Spicy', 'Woody', 'Resinous']","['Plum', 'Grapefruit']","['Heliotrope', 'Orchid']","['Amber', 'Benzoin', 'Tonka bean', 'Labdanum', 'Vanilla', 'Oud']",8.0,8.1,7.8,8.7,9.0,"['Hello everyone! The Eternal Oud is a rightly very popular fragrance by Lattafa for the following reason that it is said to smell like the Grand Soir. However, since you can only order it blind online, I wanted to dedicate my review to comparing the two fragrances directly with each other.\nLet\'s start with the fragrance itself.\nBoth the GS and the EO are very tonka/vanilla-heavy fragrances. Both fragrances are very sweet and have something resinous about them. They are also very similar to each other, but I notice a few differences in a direct comparison. The GS is sweeter, sweeter and more rounded. The EO smells less rounded, it smells rougher, less sweet, but also somehow more masculine. You can also smell something plummy, which you don\'t with the GS.\nHowever, you only notice these differences in a direct comparison. If I smelled the fragrance on someone outside, I would think that person was wearing the GS. I think that we fragrance freaks are more likely to be able to tell the difference than ""normal people"".\nI prefer the smell of GS because I like sweet fragrances. However, if you like the GS but find it too feminine, you will love the EO. If you could rate fragrances more specifically here, then the EO would be a 7.4/10 and the GS a 7.6/10\nFor me, the point goes narrowly to the Grand Soir! Performance:\nThe Grand Soir has both greater durability and a stronger silage. Point to the GS.\nFlacon:\nI only have both fragrances as a bottling, so I can\'t say anything about the handling or the spray head. However, I think the EO bottle is better. For me, the design is very interesting with the tree and the dome. The MFK bottle is just a standard MFK bottle. I find it rather mediocre. Point for the Eternal Oud.\nPrice:\nThe point clearly goes to the Eternal Oud. What you get here for the price is insane!\n\nConclusion:\nIt\'s 2:2 - a draw!\nBoth fragrances are really very similar. If you have the necessary spare change and don\'t want to worry about longevity and silage, you should get the Grand Soir.\nHowever, if you want to save money and are looking for a slightly more masculine version of the Grand Soir, the Eternal Oud is a good choice!', ""The bottle: Lattafa, how do you do it? I paid 35 EUR and didn't expect a bottle that could also cost 200 EUR. The presentation in the glass dome is great!\n\nAnd now to the fragrance: I can definitely smell parallels to Detoir Noir... But it's as if the fruitiness has been removed. Unfortunately, I haven't had the MFK GS in front of my nose yet.\nThe scent is vanilla-like and the tonka bean immediately envelops you.\nMy mother-in-law, who usually reacts very sensitively when she smells my perfumes, didn't say anything either. Is that a good sign now? Yes and no... I can't quite get to grips with the fragrance myself yet. The fragrance has this little scent of prunes in the background. You know those prunes from the metal tin? That's exactly what I smell and it makes the fragrance more edgy than round.\nI'll leave it for now, maybe my batch is too new. (Dec 2023)\nThe drydown, on the other hand, is great! After 2 hours, I no longer smell any plum either.\n\nIf anything changes, I will update."", ""Grand Soir from MFK for savers\n\nI have the Grand Soir as a bottling and have tested both fragrances extensively against each other for a few days, both on the skin (right/left) and on test strips.\n\nIn drydown, the fragrances are almost indistinguishable. I left both fragrances on test strips for several days, and the longer they lay, the less noticeable the difference. I also involved several people from my environment, and the tenor was: 'It's the same fragrance There are very slight differences, but they are really marginal.\n\nYou have to be into this kind of fragrance though. It's very heavy and probably not for a teenager. As the name 'Grand Soir' (Big Evening) suggests, it's not a fragrance to wear for sports or a day at the lake. It is more of an evening fragrance for self-confident men who want to stand out.\n\nI personally really like the fragrance and would buy it again and again.\n\nThe durability and sillage are good."", 'Lattafa Eternal Oud.\nOpening has this kind of medicinal cinnamon-fruit(maybe plum?) smell, but at the background, the Amber and vanilla is present. Doesn’t take time to notice what this fragrance is similar to... MFK GRAND SOIR!! But hold up, it’s not done. The Oud then introduces itself, but as a backbone to the ambery accord, this makes it darker than Grand soir.\n.\nLattafa has now passed the stage of being called a clone house, they now do twists of fragrances like Mancera. Speaking of mancera, some people mention this being a clone of Red tobacco or PDM Carlisle, I understand why... the style of the whole composition—from the Oud, to cinnamon, to vanilla, to that fruit—gives a very slight vibe of Mancera Red Tobacco. But just a little.\n.\nThe deep dry down familiarized me with a new note—Benzoin. That’s what really connects this fragrance to the deep dry down of another fragrance from Lattafa called Asad, and I checked, they have similar base notes, tho.\n.\nIn summary, I love it. At times, when I sniff the atomizer, I get a very realistic vanilla and Amber smell... very sexy! The presentation is off the chart for the price.\n.\nLongevity is not bad. I’m getting 8-10hrs or more. Projection is smooth, not loud or soft, just a bit above moderate. Quality is excellent, that smooth vanilla smell got me impressed.\n.\nRating- 8.5/10\n.\nI think Lattafa deserves the BRAND OF THE YEAR award, sentiments aside.', ""Have the fragrance for just under a year and found him initially hardly portable.\nHe made me quickly headache, unfortunately I do not yet know quite what that is. I suspect almost the orchid...\n\nBUT: I have now tested it again and really only a mini sprayer used and he now thus really learned to appreciate.\n\nThe fragrance notes are very well matched, he is for me very masculine, heavy but still sweet.\nOud, vanilla, plum initially clearly in the foreground. The plum subsides at some point and it remains a pleasant but fresh sweetness by the grapefruit I guess. Really grapefruit but I can not smell out.\nSo he becomes much softer after about 2 hours.\nSo you can spray him quietly 2 hours before you leave the house, at least I will do this. :)\n\nAll in all, I find the fragrance but a little too well rated. He is an absolute oud beast as I find, but also without special features.\n\nSillage and durability are really good for the price, however, I know otherwise rather from Mancera or Amouage.\n\nFlacon is of course a feast for the eyes, no other flacon is so often addressed when I show someone my collection as this one.\n\nSo it's worth it all times to include him in his collection, if he is just on sale and you're on oud. :)"", 'Who does not want to stock up on the Grand Soir is exactly right here. Not such a strong resinous note. However, clearly a dupe of the known MFK. Great bottle. Is like the MFK heavier and stronger than one thinks at first by the almost penetrating sweetness. Had to test it really several times until I liked it. You really have to let it work. The floral described in the notes...', 'This to me smells like you took PDM Layton and mixed it with sprinkling of Mancera Red Tobacco. It apparently has a lot of similarities to MFK Grand Soir, which i can see. The presentation is great but the plastic dome it comes in tends to break in shipment. Pressurized atomizer. The bottle is very heavy and the cap is metal and fits very snug. The projection and sillage...', 'this is just highly rated perfume unfortunately, the scent is very unpleasing and has no oud smell\nand they selling for 190aed\ni didnt like it at all and didnt even use 100 ml\n\n......................................................................................................................................................', ""I find this fragrance reminds me a lot of L'air du Desert Marocain...Does anyone else get this? I can't speak for Grand Soir because I've never smelled it. But these desert type of fragrances are made in abundance more than most know. I have other fragrances similar to this, so this blend is not unheard of at least to me. Jovoy's Ambre Premier and Chanel's Coromandel also..."", 'The moment I smelled this it became an instant favourite. The prune note is just a sweet fruit note not necessarily a ""prune"" per say which then fades quickly and is overpowered by the sweet vanilla, amber and touch of oud. The longevity is good and lasts more than 8 hours on skin (the first 2-3 hours with good projection) and the overall projection is above-average which...']"

Nevertheless, the Apex PARFUM has small but subtle (!) differences.\n\nIt is denser, develops more slowly (relatively normal with a high concentration) and the H/S is noticeably better - much better, to be honest. You notice the development better and you have the feeling that you can smell certain notes in the Apex PARFUM and since you smell it longer + more effectively/ better, it also comes out better.\n\nIf you are interested, the link to the review is here - https://www.parfumo.de/Parfums/Roja_Parfums/apex-parfum/rezensionen/319867 .\n\nWhat do I find better about the EDP than the more expensive perfume...?\n\nHonestly...nothing....!\n\nIt\'s lighter, brighter, fruitier, a little friendlier/more pleasant to wear, but... ! Due to its relatively modest performance, you won\'t have fun with it for long. And I\'ll be honest, if I spend 200€ to 300€ which is really ""GOOD MONEY"", then I also expect certain performance..., but what I get here are 3h to 4h of fun and then have ""close to the skin scent"".\n\nI know Roja has decent prices and co. in the end, everyone should decide for themselves whether the fragrance is worth it or not. I wouldn\'t spend it... BECAUSE there is a fragrance that has a small - subtle similarity in the development (in the drydown). And it is the Sauvage Elixir, I am not a friend of the fragrance, not a friend of the line (really bad for me).\n\nWhat I want to say is that as a designer he usually costs about 4x less and lives 4x to 5x longer and in my opinion this is one of his problems and the fact that there is the Apex PARFUM which is better in every area except price...\n\nTo whom and when do I recommend it?\n\nApart from the price thing. It\'s ok, can be used at any time of year and for virtually any occasion. My tip would be Molecule 01 to boost the performance a little. It is a fresher and lighter version than, for example, the Apex PARFUM and you want exactly this lightness - test it and then buy it if necessary, not BLIND.\n\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', ""Love at first sniff!\nIt's amazing how incredibly authentic, fruity and fresh the pineapple stands out at the beginning! It lasts for about 1-1.5 hours - then, unfortunately, it fades and the wonderful, pleasant scent of a fir tree comes through, accompanied by a masculine scent. In my opinion, it would be nicer if the pineapple remained throughout. Nevertheless, an excellent, beautiful fragrance with a USP. You will recognize it 100% among 1000 fragrances!\nYou can also smell straight away - right from the start - that this is an expensive fragrance with expensive ingredients. It has real power.\nThe longevity could be a little longer - that's probably why there's also the Apex perfume. I tested it and it definitely lasts longer.\n\nAll in all, a unique fragrance that is second to none."", 'When I was 10 or 11 my mother took me and my brothers to Dawlish to a caravan park. We went to a entertainment night, where the headline act was Cannon & Ball (sorry non-UK-Gen X and younger UK readers…go on YouTube they were huge in the UK in the 80’s) any way they were very well known acts on that show and the Headliners came on and it was comedy and etc and then it closed out with a song. Bobby Balll came back on stage and started to \'rap\' (it was the late 80s) and Tommy Cannon came out and said "" Woah woah woha what yer doin? Kids nowadays don\'t want the rapping, they want the Durty Dancin"" (again it was the late 80s and the film had just come out) and they proceeded to sing \' \'I\'ve had the time of my life\'. Now you might not know what this has got to do with this fragrance, but if as I suspected this is an attempt to appeal to a younger demographic by Roja Dove and not the dowagers, aged moneyed spinsters and tacky nouveau riche; then sheesh!\nIn this there is a very similar signature of early to mid 80s powerhouse fragrances , in the opening I could not stand a very prominent citrus, I don\'t know if it was the pineapple or the lemon, but it did not sit well with me; and this being a Roja it could\'ve been both and other citrus notes as well. I really could not wait for that to disappear. If that had stuck around I would be writing something completely different.\n\nI am surprised how much I like this, its much better than the criticism suggests, and I\'m not really a Roja Dove fan (although I do like and respect what he\'s doing insomuch of recreating a classic style of fragrance) I can see he was trying for a \'younger\' demographic but like Cannon & Ball missed the target. Not a bad shot though.', 'This is a truly extraordinary scent. At the beginning for a few moments, it is fresh, and flawless. And then comes the heart of...lightness. It is like wandering through spring forest or herb garden places next to the woods. The opening crisp is due to citrus and pineapple. The real story told by the bottle bases on the outstanding mix of labdanum, juniper berries, incense, tobacco, woods, lether. And yes, patchouli - so gentle, yet significant, in the set. I love Apex EAU DE PARFUM from the first sniff.']"

Everyone was talking about business ladies and office fragrances. I couldn't do anything with it....When Le Parfum arrived, I was hooked. Such a wonderfully round, soft vanilla-honey flatterer. At the same time sexy and elegant, slightly fresh and soapy with a hint of lavender. Striking, but still suitable for everyday wear. And suddenly I liked all the Libres. The Intense as a predecessor to Le Parfum, the EdP as a freshie, light clean fragrance. Both are now on my WL.\nRecently, my office job came up and the question arose: what do you actually wear? I'm a gourmand fan, I love sweet, heavy, intense, loud scents. I don't care outside, I wear what I want. But I don't want to get on my work colleagues' nerves. So I needed something that was easy to wear but at the same time eye-catching enough, because (and I don't see this as a problem) I also like to be smelled and to smell my perfume for myself for a long time throughout the day.

From the first notes to the long-lasting base notes, a fascinating olfactory experience unfolds. The top notes are fresh and invigorating, while a harmonious blend of floral accords unfolds at the heart of the fragrance. But the true masterpiece is revealed in the deep, sensual base notes, which leave behind an irresistible aura of luxury and passion.\n\nThe longevity of this perfume is impressive because it stays with me all day without losing intensity and longevity is always the most important thing for me. Every time I wear it, others talk to me about the fragrance.

The subtly sweet and warming base with vanilla and tonka bean is also more prominent here than in the EdP.\nOverall, I would describe the EdP as somewhat lighter, fresher and more suitable for spring than Le Parfum. For fall and winter, however, Libre Le Parfum is simply perfect.\nThe fragrance is fresh, yet sweet, warming and accompanies you through the day.\nYou perceive yourself, the fragrance knocks again and again throughout the day and calls out to you in a pleasant way. It\'s there, but it doesn\'t disturb you or become unpleasant.\nIt lasts really well on me, I can still smell it well after 12 hours and close to the skin after 18 hours.\nThe sillage is strong at first, but after 1-2 hours it is no longer so extreme for others, which is actually really good, because it doesn\'t annoy anyone.\nThanks to the lavender, Libre Le Parfum, which is actually marketed by YSL as a women\'s fragrance, is also very wearable for men, as it gives the fragrance a masculine note.\nI personally associate this type of fragrance with the SOTN of the cool guys from the 90s. I couldn\'t name a specific scent, but I get vibes from the big nightclubs of the 90s.\nThe sample is almost empty... winter is approaching. The bottle needs to move in soon.', ""From the first blast this is an elegant and very pleasing lavender vanilla aroma. It's very strong at first, but mellows out nicely.

These then - how could it be otherwise? - These are then pushed further and further forward in the course of the fragrance, so that in the (late) drydown, these notes are absorbed and rounded off by a slightly ambery vanilla.\nIn the promo for the fragrance, Cecile Zarokian states that the fragrance is modeled on the authentic scent of a cigar that is lit and then gradually burns down. With a little imagination, this image can actually be reproduced. Initially pungent, balsamic, spicy and ethereal, then increasingly smoother, smokier and creamier. In terms of artistry and craftsmanship, the fragrance can therefore only receive top marks. Grandiose.\nThe H/S is flawless, room-filling and intense. At work, after several hours of the fragrance on my skin, I was asked what made the whole room smell so seductively wintry, but also warm and inviting; incense sticks and wellness associations came to mind.\nConclusion: Amouages Royal Tobacco is an absolute recommendation for fans of strong, smoky-dry and green-spicy fragrances, in which tobacco is actually interpreted as very dry, cool and warm at the same time, and therefore not gourmand-like! 9/10', 'This smells of frankincense and fenugreek. Maybe if I took my time, smelled it a bit more, I would get tobacco and perhaps other notes, but, on it\'s face, this is 100 percent frankincense and fenugreek.\n\nI say fenugreek not because I\'m familiar with this note, but because of how everyone else described it and, yep, I get it. Discursively, adding it was quite brilliant. It works beautifully with the frankincense.\n\nSo while this is not a bad fragrance, it\'s not what it promises from the tin. You see ""tobacco"" and ""Amouage"" and you begin to conjure up fantasies of dense, rich, opulent tobacco. And when that expectation is met with a wildly different scent profile, it\'s rather anticlimactic. Albeit a good fragrance.', 'Tons of tobacco fragrances out there, this one gives me Hookah vibes. It smells like I\'m walking through the Arab quarter of Jerusalem, there is a spice to it, a smokiness to it, and a sweetness.\n\nAt first spray, there is almost this chocolate scent, like a very milky chocolate....reminds me of chocolate milk if you only add a little chocolate so that the milk becomes almost identical in color to the bottle here.\n\n10-15 minutes into this, it becomes more spicy, and the smoke comes out a bit more, less sweet.\n\nThis is one of the most authentic tobacco\'s I\'ve come across, very different than:\n\nTobacco Vanille EAU DE PARFUM\nTobacco Flirting with Vanilla\n""XJ 1861 Naxos | XerJoff""\nBack to Black Aphrodisiac PERFUME\nBeverly Hills Exclusive\n\nWhat is it closest to? I would say Tobacco Vanille, but other than both of these having tobacco involved, that\'s about as close as it gets. TV to me is more of a pipe tobacco smell, and this is very clearly middle eastern.\n\nI\'m not sure how this will smell to others around you, I could see people not wanting to smell this on someone. I particularly enjoy it on myself so I\'ll use it...but out of the other tobacco fragrances listen I would have to say this would be the most \'challenging\' of them all.', 'When you just smell the 2ml sample vial without even spraying it, it gives a lot of accords - the first thing you notice is the sweetness, but that is quickly followed with a deep smoky undertone. These same accords are transferred onto paper or skin. I partially get why people think it\'s fruity in the vial, but that won\'t show when you actually spray it.\n\nSo what does it smell like and what do the notes remind me of? If you just smell it on paper, the sweetness that you will notice at the top is driven by the licorice root, very similar to the vibe you get when you smell Initio\'s Oud for Happiness, a fresh-sweet all-year scent. On skin, at the opening, I get more smoky and ambery than I get the sweetness, but I do see some similarities in the air to Royal Crown\'s Sultan, a vanilla-oud gourmand, once we get out of the instant drydown.\n\nAs the scent evolves, it gets darker and darker. The base hits in a different way - I would compare it to asphalt being installed or a burnt tire (my interpretation of what the birch tar base note does). This hydrocarbon-type vibe is something you see in some other scents, e.g. Xerjoff\'s Don and Carner\'s Cuirs. You really have to smell it from up close to notice it.\n\nThe base has that Amouage DNA, but this is nothing like the animalic oud you get from Opus XIII Silver Oud (I saw it in the ""Reminds me of"" section of the other website). The birch tar and tobacco serve as a solid base to build upon, and the smoky-resinous spiciness is not something that goes away. Closer to Interlude, but there\'s not really anything like this in the market. Think of it as an evolution for the fruity-leather profile while also not being as ""safe for work"".\n\nOne thing that I do notice is that this doesn\'t actually perform as strong as some of the other scents from Amouage. Note: I am yet to try this in cold weather, given we are in August. My opinions are likely to change on this part, but for now, I think this sillage is not more than average (7/10) and the longevity will be there, but it won\'t be infinite-level like some oud fragrances (8/10 max).\n\nI\'ve tried a lot of stuff since I got into the hobby more than a year ago now, and this is an absolute standout. Certain to add it by the end of the year if not sooner. Extremely unique creation and not something that Amouage does a lot as a house (i.e. combining sweetness with harshness). I say that after I just went through Amouage\'s 12x2ml men\'s discovery. Objectively, this has too much going on for it to be mainstream and blind-buy safe, but if you\'re somebody that does this for the art of it and wants something that nobody else has, this is literally made for you. This isn\'t Naxos and this isn\'t Herod.', 'Tobacco is the cornerstone of this fragrance. An empty cigar box, dried tobacco leaves, the smoky ritual of lighting a cigar. But also like a cornerstone, an entire house is built upon it; an incredibly gorgeous façade of anise, basil, osmanthus, frankincense, oud, and amber. This is not Tabac 28 which just seeks to recreate the scent of running a cigar under your nose, this is baroque opulence and grandeur; a maximalist and exaggerated interpretation of tobacco.\n\nFirst thing\'s first; let\'s talk about the liquorice. This note sadly puts many people off from fully enjoying this fragrance. It is the first thing that you smell because the top anise note blends with the middle liquorice note - leading many people to smell it off the strip and decide against it. I\'m not going to say ""give it a full wearing,"" because that note does linger throughout the life of the fragrance, and if you\'re not a fan, this fragrance is not going to be for you, especially for the price. It\'s not easy to find at discounters either.\n\nIt doesn\'t bother me that not everyone will enjoy this scent. Isn\'t that the point of niche perfume? To explore and find something that is uniquely you and appeals to you, even if it doesn\'t appeal to everyone else. But if you do happen to enjoy the opening, it gets even better from there.\n\nThe eponymous tobacco enters as a middle note, but does not dominate. It blends harmoniously with the spices (basil and fenugreek, which I didn\'t personally smell until the third full wearing of this fragrance), and of course with the frankincense, Amouage\'s (and Oman\'s) speciality. Warmth emanates from this scent, generated by the smoky birch tar lighting the frankincense and tobacco aflame.\n\nIn the drydown, benzoin, myrrh, labdanum, and vanilla combine into a rich amber accord, while the tonka, vetiver, and musk round out the scent. The light woodiness from the oud and guaiac finally come through. This is one of those fragrances that is a journey in scent - from first spray to 12 hours later when the scent somehow still lingers to your skin, it morphs and shifts, yet still possesses the same signature from top to bottom.\n\nIs Royal Tobacco a tobacco fragrance? If you are looking for simply a recreation of the scent of a lit cigar, then no. It is much, much more.', ""Library collection, a collection designed by Amouage to offer fragrances characterized by unusual accords and scents that are always bold and unexpected. Cécile Zarokian took inspiration in making this perfume from the tradition of 'El lector'; people who entertained Cuban cigar makers by reading novels and literary works. Royal Incense and Royal Tobacco, Oman and Cuba...."", '… as I had just shelled out $300 for 100ml. The opening is very “unique”, very strong, and definitely not for everyone. There’s so much happening at once, especially in that opening. Give it a while and it starts to settle in, and then you get an idea of where it’s going to take you. It goes from a straight up incense vibe, very smokey, to a sweet, still smokey,...', ""I love Amouage as a house and they have created some of my favourite to wear fragrances. This one I'm not too sure about. It reminds of quite a few similar fragrances especially Fan Your Flames. It might be my nose but I don't get much tobacco, just a load of smokey incense. It's pleasant to wear and I would say totally not unisex, this is a male scent. Definitely a cold..."", 'From the beginning I had high expectations for this fragrance. I was just waiting for a good opportunity to get a flacon. The fragrance opens with a strong hit of a dense blend consisting of candied fruits, a hefty dose of licorice and an ashtray of water-drenched slush. As the scent develops, the tobacco fades first and sweet incense resins become prominent. This moment for...', 'This scent is way to complex for me to understand or review. The only thing I can say: it is such fun to wear and discover how it evolves throughout the day. Definitely no blind buy - you have to love incense, you have to like tobacco - and you have to like smokiness. For me it also smells very dry. I love it - but I am a sucker for incense.']"

The scent is sweet-spicy. It is still in production.  ,['unisex'],['Roja Dove'],"['Sweet', 'Spicy', 'Oriental', 'Woody', 'Floral']","['Basil', 'Lavender', 'Bergamot']","['Coconut', 'Heliotrope', 'Grasse jasmine', 'May rose', 'Violet']","['Clove', 'Cinnamon', 'Tobacco', 'Vanilla', 'Benzoin', 'Musk', 'Pine', 'Pink pepper', 'Cedarwood', 'Ginger', 'Oakmoss', 'Patchouli', 'Vetiver']",8.4,7.7,7.2,9.2,6.2,"['Manhattan embodies the Art Déco art style, which had its heyday in the 1920s. Manhattan is a tribute to a bygone era in which people looked to the future with hope and thus, with hard work, remained fit for the future. Manhattan is a reminder of the hedonistic and shocking appearance of nightclubs at the time, mainly because of their lascivious appearance, which had a worldwide impact Manhattan is therefore initially an amber fragrance, but it also has modern, forward-looking elements. Rose, jasmine and heliotrope are placed on a classic stage of vanilla and tonka bean, and a whisper of tobacco can be heard, reminiscent of nightclubs. At the front of the bottle is the Chrysler Building, a representative of Art Deco, which gives off magical and obscure light reflections at night. This is why the perfume bottle is still black, while the EdP version now depicts the building during the day.\n\nSo much for the explanations of Roja Dove (translated, summarized).\nI find it really exciting to take a look behind the scenes at how a perfume like this is created. For me, it is clear that Dove has dealt intensively with the subject and created a perfume that comes closest to his interpretation of this period. Even if you don\'t agree with it, I think it makes sense to at least know what the idea behind the perfume was. This can then influence your own perception again.\n\nFor me, Manhattan is a sweet to very sweet fragrance, but it is well balanced and therefore exudes a pleasant cloud of fragrance. The spiciness is at the limit for me personally, fragrances like Spicebomb Extreme tend to just overwhelm me. The spiciness is also much more noticeable on the strip than on the skin and in everyday life, so it\'s fine there.\nI am a little cautious with sweet fragrances, as they can easily be overwhelming for me, after all, you have to ""stand"" behind the fragrance for hours; the sillage, which I would prefer to rate at 7.5 points, is perfect here - in my opinion, such a value is even better than 9 or 10, which is often simply too much of a good thing for me.\n\nDespite its sweetness, the fragrance still has a pleasant lightness. I can easily smell coconut, which gives it a fresh kick, but as is so often the case with fragrances from this company, a lot of well-balanced substances are used, so that no one note stands out in particular. Describing it as a (fairly) sweet, vanilla, spicy scent is pretty accurate in my opinion. The development of the fragrance also reminds me a little of the character of Tobacco Vanilla, even though the scent is completely different. Although tobacco is only described as a ""whisper"" in Dove\'s fragrance, I find this character essential in Manhattan. The longevity is very good; after 6-7 hours my nose had gotten used to the scent and I thought that was it, but in the evening after a good 10 hours I clearly noticed the scent again (it was warmer again), it lasted well all day.\n\nIf the price is 250€ for the 100ml, I think the PL is actually quite ok - that puts you (roughly) in the Xerjoff range, for example, and is actually still well below Tom Ford prices (which is a completely different topic again...). I think Manhattan is worth a test if you are looking for a sweet-spicy, complex fall/winter fragrance. I don\'t think I need to mention that the bottle is a dream. Especially in the context of this fragrance, which contains a clear reference to art, it seems to me more than appropriate to offer a correspondingly artistic presentation.', ""Manhattan by ROJA Parfums\nWhat a stunner this is!\nAnd I’m not just talking about the presentation which is just beautiful.\n\nThis seems to have been tailor made for me.\n\nIn one word: Boujee And I mean it.\n\nIt manages to be both warm, spicy, rich, enveloping, opulent…\n…AND bright, sparkly, aromatic, energetic, classy, elegant.\n\nThe opening on this is truly breathtaking to me.\nA bright bergamot dancing with coconut and floral nuances with a slice of freshly cut ginger and a couple of basil leaves on top.\nIn fact - the opening leads you to believe this will be a gourman leaning scent in a similar fashion Ambre Narguile or Nobile's La Danza delle Libellule do, but... Nope!\n\nThis develops. A lot!\n\nA few minutes later, the florals give Manhattan a bit more complexity with crisp freshness from Violet, elegance from rose, carnal touches from jasmine and powdery Almondy nuances from heliotrope.\n\nThere’s a soft spiciness throughout the whole experience with pink pepper and the ginger. The basil and pine nuances balance it out.\n\nThen comes the rich and opulent base of vanilla, musk, light vegetal tobacco, cinnamon, cloves, benzoin and cedar mainly.\n\nThis never gets too sweet, too woody, too crisp. It’s simply put: perfectly balanced to my nose.\n\nIn typical ROJA fashion: SPARKLY. And this never gets old to me.\n\nRich. Complex. Busy. Energetic. Classy. Opulent.\nManhattan. New York.\n\nIt just fits me and moves me; and that's more than enough to me."", 'Hello everyone,\n\ntoday there is a ""small"" review of Manhattan EAU DE PARFUM .\n\nYes, it took 2 years and several attempts ... with you (the fragrance).\nThe real spark didn\'t ignite back then and I can\'t even say exactly why it was like that, who knows. Nowadays I can say - luckily I have NEVER lost sight of it.\n\nWhat do we have here?\n\nTo say this in a short sentence is really ultra difficult to hardly possible and probably doesn\'t do justice to the fragrance, but I\'ll give it a try (more or less). On the one hand, you really have to say that Roja\'s fragrances are very complex scents - they feel like they change every 10 minutes = new facets and accords come and go. In general, the Manhattan EAU DE PARFUM is a sweet, spicy, creamy, floral and in the drydown we have some woods and green notes.\n\nBecause of the second point of similarity:\n\nThe fragrance is OWN and not a copy of something else, certainly not! But you notice a certain influence or inspiration from 2 very well-known fragrances, the Tobacco Vanille EAU DE PARFUM and the Naxos and I would like to say something about the Naxos and their similarities!\nI have known the Naxos since 2015 (have an old one, among others) and I think I know it better than many others ;) . The fragrance notes such as lavender, cinnamon, tobacco, vanilla and this creamy one also have both and it is also noticeable (!), that\'s why I see this parallel. But in the end that\'s it, because the Naxos is a different LEAGUE as far as the H/S is concerned. But do you really always want this...?\n\nOn the subject of durability and sillage:\n\nThe sillage is really strong in the first 1, 2 hours and then it recedes noticeably in a bubble or scent cloud of around 1 meter, then it remains relatively calm until the end. On the subject of longevity, we\'re talking about 7 to 9 hours (easy to perceive), after which it becomes a ""skin scent"", but I think that\'s a good thing!\nWhy?\n\nI have a lot of ""breakers"" and I simply can\'t wear those fragrances on certain occasions because they are too potent and too penetrating for most people. Many of us celebrate such things and to be honest I also like it when my fragrance is strong (making a statement, getting noticed etc.), but there are also moments such as in the car, train, plane etc. when you shouldn\'t wear something like Alexandria II PARFUM from 2018, Alexandria II Anniversary, a pre-order Tony Iommi Monkey Special etc., but something discreet, elegant and extremely chic.\n\nYes, it could sometimes have a little more POWER, but to all those I say, take Molecule 01 and this ""problem"" has been satisfactorily solved.\n\nSomething else important!\n\nI know there are a lot of people here for whom the factor ""how my fragrance is received"" is really very, very important. I would like to say 2 things to all of them. Firstly, a fragrance is a part of me/ a part of my character and I have never adorned myself with ""other people\'s feathers"" just to please the opposite sex ""more"", I see that critically, but that is a personal feeling.\n\nOn the other hand, I have smelled about 1000 fragrances in my life, but as far as the subject of pleasantness and how it is received is concerned, the Manhattan EAU DE PARFUM is one of the best and that with both sexes! It is almost frightening how well it is received. In terms of that alone - you have to try it!\n\nAnd now, almost finally, to the point about the ""dear price"", let me put it this way: if we say we have a certain desire for luxury products / fragrance products in the niche sector, then I find it difficult or quite honestly almost pointless to chalk this up as something negative. Nobody is forcing us to spend this money. If you ask me now: Benny is it worth it? Then I say, if you want to spend it, test it and then buy it, but I recommend everyone to test it! You just have to experience it - the art of what is / can be possible.\n\nNow a brief word on the subject of my opinion:\n\nI am not sponsored, influenced by anyone, receive money or anything else. I approach the subject of parfumo as I am, honestly, everything else is not mine. My real personal opinion is worth a lot to me and maybe I hope ;) that you notice that. If I don\'t like something, e.g. OVP, bottle, sprayer or H/S, then I communicate this too!\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', 'The Manhattan is a great multi-layered fragrance for me.\nYou can feel that many fragrance notes have been processed, but still in such a way that it is perfectly coordinated.\nYou can really feel the work behind this fragrance, the attention to detail.\n\nAt first I get something slightly ""fresh"" and a great lavender accord. This combination of lavender, bergamot and a hint of basil is really beautiful.\nBut I also immediately sense a certain spiciness and other notes in general, which I find difficult to recognize individually.\nSlightly peppery, some clove & cinnamon and other individual notes.\nI don\'t find the fragrance particularly floral, even though there are some floral notes in the fragrance pyramid.\n\nTowards the end, the fragrance goes noticeably in a patchouli, vetiver direction with musk. In general, it also simply becomes woodier.\n\nI like the fragrance.\nIt could project and last a little better. I have a little trouble with that on my skin. Especially when I have the price in mind.\nNevertheless, it is a really beautifully crafted fragrance.', 'I just received the fragrance this morning and after giving it a full wearing I can confirm that this is going to be my go-to-scent for the upcoming winter months.\n\nThe scent starts with a sparkling mix of citrus, aromatic notes and tobacco. Although not being redundant the opening gives me a similar feeling like wearing the Enigma (Creation E) Parfum Cologne.\n\nAfter about 15mins the citrus component starts to fade and the tobacco gets more prominent. Spicy and ambery/vanilla tones start to overshadow the aromatic notes. About an hour into the wearing I do see why people compare this fragrance to Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford.\n\nThis fragrance is still different to Tobacco Vanille, it only shares some facets.\nAnother facet of the fragrance is the ginger note which is probably responsible for the sparkling opening and remains as an uplifting character in the scent at this stage.\nIn addition, the coconut notes gives a fragrance a smooth character and the pine note adds some woody character. This stage of the fragrance remains for about 4 hours until the fragrance makes a slight turn again.\n\nDeep in the drydown, maybe at the 5 or 6 hour mark, a rose note shines through. To be honest, I wasn’t looking at the note breakdown at first and I was wondering where the rosy smell came from until I noticed that it must be me. Then I checked the fragrance notes and saw there is rose inside.\n\nI couldn’t detect the fragrance anymore after about 7 to 8 hours after application.\n\nAs you can see, the fragrance is very complex and although I used other fragrances to describe the scent, the fragrance happens to be very unique to my nose. I understand why many people take comparisons the TV but this one is not as linear and also more subtle. I wouldn’t consider this being a weak fragrance at all but TV is definitely more projecting and also longer lasting, however, I see Manhattan definitely more office and work appropriate.\n\nToday, I enjoyed every minute of the wearing experience and I’m definitely going to wear this one with the same excitement during the winter months.\n\nConsidering bottle and presentation, I guess there’s not much to say except it’s gorgeous.\n\nTalking about the price, I understand that 350€ (300£) is a steep price tag for a fragrance but considering presentation and the complexity of the scent, the price is justified in my opinion.\n\nI find this fragrance more on the masculine side on my skin, however it would be interesting to see how it develops on feminine skin. I usually don’t put genders on fragrances and I think woman can easily wear the fragrance with confidence as well.', ""Reminds me of Xerjoff 's Naxos creamy notes. The initial spray is outstanding and with effervescent hints and the dry down is warm, creamy and inviting. This should be a great fall and winter perfume. I would say this leans more masculine.\n\nThis is so nice. Overall, I'm very pleased with this blind buy Roja creation.""]"

I wear it very often, often when I don't have a specific perfume in mind for the day, I often reach for Gaultier² between my other fragrances!\n\nI can recommend everyone to smell the fragrance several times and give it a little time if you don't warm up to it straight away.\nIn my eyes a must have from the designer segment."", 'I bought the fragrance as soon as it came out because I really wanted to try it out. When it arrived, I immediately unpacked the package. When I smelled the ""tester"" I was a little disappointed as I had expected more. I put the packaging in the cupboard and left the tester on my bedside table. After about a week, I tested it again and suddenly I fell in love with the fragrance. I particularly like the vanilla note. It is not too present and very pleasant.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that the fragrance is very worthwhile for the price and in retrospect I was not disappointed', 'I\'ve been really into perfume for a little over a year now, so much so that I call it a ""hobby"" or passion. My activity on this platform also goes hand in hand with this. Today I finally did it. I have populated the ""Signature Scent"" section on my profile page.\n\nAnd as you can probably guess, it\'s Gaultier² (2022). Why is that? I\'ll explain that to you! In the meantime, a steadily growing number of fragrances have found their way into the collection. But I always reach for Gaultier2. It always works. Many fragrances remind me of other fragrances in whole or in part. I haven\'t smelled Gaultier2 like this anywhere else; the fragrance is unique to me (unfortunately, I don\'t know the original; I don\'t have to, as I like this one as it is).\n\nIt can be worn anywhere and at any time, is not too loud, not too quiet, does not offend. In short, it\'s an ""all-rounder"" when you can\'t make up your mind, don\'t want to think or don\'t feel like doing anything else; at any time of day or year.\n\nI can\'t really describe the fragrance. For me, it\'s more of a composition than individual notes that I perceive. A sweet, floral, soft creaminess that caresses you cleanly. Linear, without any major changes over time. I notice the fragrance for a really long time, even on my clothes the next day. It is a little louder in the first few hours, but not a beast. After that, it gently envelops you. And I don\'t really like floral fragrances, but here they are composed to perfection. It just makes me feel good when I wear it.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me is that it is (more or less) a limited edition and only available directly from JPG, which of course triggers FOMO. I already have a bunker bottle on backup, but I think I\'m leaning towards another bottle if I can get it for a good price here in the souk. The maturing time by letting it stand is also quite good for it. My first usable bottle is from spring \'23 and has matured nicely in the meantime.\n\nI\'m curious to see whether I\'ll be able to sniff any more fragrances like this as my journey of discovery continues. Because many are great, only a few are really brilliant.', 'First of all, I would like to note that I do not know the origin fragrance Gaultier2, so can not draw comparisons old to new.\n\nThe current Gaultier 2 smells great to me, he combines in a casual way elements of amber, vanilla and musk to a successful composition.\nUnfortunately, he holds with me at least not very long. I wish it had a longer life.\n\nIn my opinion, the Gaultier 2 is a fragrance that is perfect for a variety of occasions, date, casual or office.\n\nIn summary, as with almost every fragrance from JPG, you can not go wrong here.', 'This fragrance was brought back from the dead in a survey on the Jean Paul Gaultier website when the majority voted for a new edition of the discontinued original Gaultier² (2005). How well swarm intelligence sometimes works! As far as I know, the fragrance is only available to buy on the Jean Paul Gaultier website. I find the new bottle very...', 'Original Gaultier2: amber, vainille, mochus Gaultier2 new: jasmine, sandalwood, and ambergris Call me crazy, but it makes him, a flanker. For the same reason the complaints, because it should not be announced with great fanfare that ""Gaultier2 is coming back"" even though it is NOT Gaultier2. It\'s not about believing or thinking on anything, they are facts, they don\'t carry...', ""I knew the 2005 and was surprised when it was reissued. It's not 1-1 the same but for me it's still one of Jean Paul gaultier's best fragrances. The jasmine note mixed with vanilla is just a dream. I think it's a beautiful sweet oriental fragrance with a special class. Musk and sandalwood refine the whole thing and make it round. I would buy it again and again. Lasts a good..."", ""This is the original with a few tweaks. . This scent is amazing! First, I loved the original 2005 version. Really was amazing when I was 20 years old and now still amazing when im 33. I was so scared when I first bought this because I didn't think it would give me all the feelings I got when I first smelled it that young. BUT BEHOLD, IT HELD ITS OWN & GAVE ME THAT...""]"

The scent is sweet-fruity. Projection and longevity are above-average. It is being marketed by Puig.,['male'],"['Christophe Raynaud', 'Quentin Bisch']","['Sweet', 'Fruity', 'Synthetic', 'Spicy', 'Floral']","['Apple', 'Davana']","['Tonka bean', 'Turkish rose', 'Osmanthus']","['Vanilla', 'Davana', 'Cedarwood', 'Patchouli']",7.7,8.4,8.0,7.1,7.3,"['The One Million Elixir receives comparatively little attention and mention here on Parfumo and also on social media. So is it not that good? Or perhaps underrated? Let\'s find out...\n\nThe elixir opens with a lovely apple note. There is also a slight bubblegum note, but it is really only subtle. However, this bubblegum note also gives a nice sweetness right at the beginning and probably comes from the davana. The opening is also completely alcoholic.\nAfter a while, the floral notes become perceptible, but these are also rather subtle. The sweetness also builds up more and more.\nIn the drydown, the incredibly beautiful and high-quality vanilla note unfolds, which has a strikingly natural effect and is subtly supported by the cedar wood - brilliant.\nYes, the One Million DNA is recognizable, but really far in the background. The Elixir is the big brother, more grown-up and serious and, above all, also suitable for men up to the age of 30.\n\nThe Elixir is clearly a fragrance for the current season, fall and winter are its home. Going out, partying etc. are its areas of application. But I think it also works well discreetly in the office. Compliments are guaranteed.\n\nLongevity is out of this world, I could still easily detect the elixir on my arm 24 hours after spraying it on. The radiance is not out of this world, but still very good and present.\n\nThis One Million has definitely earned the Elixir label, the fragrance itself as well as its performance. I answer the question with ""yes"", the One Million Elixir is underrated...', 'In theory, this perfume would have been great about 5,6 years ago when the market was not yet full with the sweet tonka and vanilla with fruity accords scents.\n\nI must admit that even if the DNA of the scent is nothing new, I really enjoy it and wear it with pleasure, it gives a nice fruity Erba Pura start and then after a while it becomes nice and almost romantic.\n\nIf you like BOSS Bottles Intense, Armani Code Absolu or Layton .. you will like this one too, on top of that it lasts a long time and has quite a projection.\n\nI dislike the bottle big time, for sure it would look kitchy on every possible shelf, even if you live in a student´s dormitory, this gold design is simply not to my liking. But the perfume is and I think is a good flanker from Paco Rabanne with the right price for the younger buyers.']"
