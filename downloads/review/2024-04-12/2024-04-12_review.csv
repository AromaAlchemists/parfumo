The scent is sweet-gourmand. Projection and longevity are above-average.

Quite badly this was with the Guidance I really did not bear at all.\n\nThe fragrance starts very nice gourmandig and smells like baked apple with cinnamon. I was totally happy that I did not smell anything from the Akigalawood. But after a few minutes, this note then rose to my nose, at first only discreetly, but with time more intense.\n\nDirectly on the skin it remains very gourmandig for a long time, the sillage, however, consists for me really very quickly exclusively of Akigalawood.\n\nI own, by the way, the Angels' Share and can really not understand that many smell there a similarity. The Angels Share smells for me intensely hazelnut, woods and cognac and also the sillage is dominated by these notes.\n\nThe only common denominator for me is the cinnamon and the classification as winter fragrances.\n\nThe Angels Share also smells very linear to me, while the Khamrah has a changing scent progression.\n\nFor me, these are two completely independent fragrances.\n\nThe flacon, however, I find super high-quality! Since you really get something for your money and if you like the fragrance character, then you really get a very qualitative fragrance. Price-performance ratio therefore top."", ""Short and sweet; I'll leave it to others to enjoy their own eloquence.\nThe packaging is very successful and of high quality, as is the bottle. The lid is made of plastic, but that is forgivable.\nSpray head also absolutely fine.\n\nThe fragrance itself is very sweet, but with a spicy note, which definitely sets it apart from other sweet winter fragrances. Over time, it becomes a little duller and more mature. Perfect for restaurant visits during the cold season. Since its DNA is not terribly complicated, there is hardly any question of whether to buy it or not. Anyone who likes sweet fragrances with a spicy, grown-up note is well advised here, especially in terms of price. Blind buy.\n\nLongevity is definitely fair for the price, it is strongly perceptible for 6 hours, after which it fades. i can definitely get 8 hours of overall wear out of it before it gets too close to the body.\n\nIn short: a nobrainer in winter for all fans of sweet perfumes.\nIf you want a somewhat simpler, more affordable fragrance that is very similar except for the spice, Otto Kern Beyond Horizon is a good choice in my opinion."", 'I think the Khamrah is an independent fragrance (with similar fragrance DNA) and not a direct clone.\n\nI am really totally thrilled with the Khamrah.\nFor me, it seems a little less sweet and less cinnamon- and caramel-heavy than Angels Share, but a little woodier and, unlike Angels Share, I perceive a baked apple and date note in the opening.\n\nAlthough the hype has died down a little in the meantime, it was/is totally justified in my opinion, especially when you look at the price/performance ratio The longevity is very good and the sillage is also at least upper-mediocre.\nThe bottle and the general packaging also look very high quality for the price.\nOnce again the oriental fragrance house Lattafa convinces me. :)\n\nI can hardly wait to wear the fragrance for the first time at a Christmas market :)', ""The Khamrah is a wonderful fragrance in my eyes.\nWhen you consider the average price you can get it for, it's really amazing.\n\nA fragrance that is perfect for the cold days of the year.\nWarming, sweet-oriental impressions that invite you to feel good.\n\nCinnamon, vanilla, date, tonka bean, praline and Siamese benzoin in a dreamlike interplay.\nThe top notes in particular evoke associations with delicious desserts/sweets. Desserts that are often eaten in winter.\nPossibly even baked apple vibes.\nThis is really super nice!\nOver time, this slight baked apple impression fades a little for me, but the sweet notes still remain.\nThe cinnamon comes out a little better and the fragrance also takes on more creamy notes.\n\nThe performance is really good and once again you can only say that it's simply great for this price.\nHats off to Lattafa, but Lattafa is known for creating very good fragrances for affordable prices."", 'Why are you wearing a men\'s perfume? I\'m asked that too often. Let\'s just get that nasty question out of the way first, shall we?\nWhile there are certain scent profiles that seem inherintly female or male, that\'s because we as a society deem them such. Floral & sweet = female, whereas spicy-woody or clean-citrussy is male. As someone who wore (another of those horrific labels) “old lady” fragrances at 16 - meaning similar ones to my mom\'s scenterie – I don\'t care for boxes. Yes, I like sweet, I like floral, I even like fruity (which, apparently is “too young” for me, sigh). But I also like woody. And spicy. And ambery. The only reason I\'m not into leathery or yellow citrus perfumes is because my skin chemistry does awful things with it.\n\nSo many times I\'ve seen a ""homme"" fragrance\'s pyramid and thought ""Ehm, make the bottle \'girly\' and it could easily become popular on the women shelves. Sweet scents haven\'t been just for the ladies in a long time, and if you look at Middle Eastern perfumes, where the majority is unisex to begin with, you\'ll see that the guy-fums maybe have a little more (w)oudh or spice, but not always. I personally think when it comes to perfumes they have the right majority-idea: everything is for everybody.\n\nReview>>\nWhich brings me to the Fragrance of the Story: the much lauded, much hyped Lattafa -Khamrah. While it\'s officially an Arabic concoction considered the second coming of Angel\'s Share, a popular men\'s fragrance by Killian, most of us know it\'s only *loosely* inspired by the boozy apple pie juice. The bottle is duped. The scent? Meeeeh.\n\nEven though the Angels didn\'t protest to sharing, Lattafa took its pyramid, extracted what they liked most, then doubled down on their own Middle Eastern twist and voila: a gorgeous brown liquid in beautiful bottle entered YouTube Frag-circles and everyone went a lil\' cray-cray. (THX for that by the way. Not. I tested it júst after release, but had to wait for €€ to buy a full bottle. By the time I could, the hype had doubled the price here.\nEdit: after 2 Souk\'ers didn\'t reply to my ""I\'d like to buy your bottle"" I was about to get a 2nd, bigger, decant when lucky me got a Notino notification: Khamrah was back in stock AND only €44,- ex 3.95 shipping. So, I\'m going to enjoy the Lattafa next winter for the original price! ).\n\nWhich begs the question: is it really worth it? Sadly, quite often a hype is nothing more than every social media channel copying someone else to stay somewhat relevant. So, am I bravely fighting the label-posse for naught?\nTo be honest, I rarely find the prices of perfumes ""worth it"", but I do think a lot of people will like this fragrance - men and women. Fair warning though – again- : if you are attracted to Khamrah because you\'re dreaming of smelling like Angel\'s Share for a fraction of the price... don\'t buy it. There are certainly nice dupes*, with a twist and with a very close to Killian-DNA, but both in its pyramid aswell as its scent on my skin, Khamrah is simply a unisex gourmand that could be loved by Angel Share enthusiasts on its own merit. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe pyramid >>\nIf you\'re into a bit of sweet with a whole lotta kick, Khamrah will light up your day. Especially if that sweet isn\'t floral or fruity, but closer to end of the year yummies (for those countries celebrating Xmas).\n\nKhamrah has a gingerbread meets cinnamon rolls kind of sweetness with a few extra delicious things thrown in. Which isn\'t strange considering the notes of cinnamon and nutmeg in the top.\nIn the opening these two spices are strong and when they start to diminish a bit, the cinnamon never leaving completely, they get company from tuberose and milk chocolate covered dates. Yum!\n\nOn some days however, I had an issue with that tuberose. I\'m unsure if it was my hormone levels, my diet or something else, but there were certainly moments when the tuberose turned skanky, ruining the entire composition, overpowering everything else in the juice. Think of throwing away a bouquet of flowers that has been standing a few days too long. You take them out of the vase, inhale the leftover water, aaand get a very distinct sweet-sour, almost rotting smell. Thàt. Thàt.\nRuined Khamrah for me. It could be the bergamot pullling strongly, mixing with the white flower and turning her indolic. It is why – in case I\'m not alone – I recommend spread testing with a decant. Not a blind buy.\n\nOn the days the note, or better said: my skin, behaved the flower simply added sweetness that translated somehow as a very coconutty heart – straight into the base.\n\nThat base leans heavily on vanilla and the three woods; Mahogany from the heart, and Akigala + Amber woods on the bottom tier. Here and there the benzoin and myrrhe give it extra depth and warmth. I\'ve often heard describe Khamrah as “boozy”, but I\'m not getting any of that. Just like the apple pie has never entered my olfactory senses when wearing this chique Lattafa.\n\nThese are just two of the reasons why, for me, Khamrah is its own fragrance. A gourmand that might attract Angel\'s Share lovers because those are gourmand lovers – not due to the overwhelming similarities. I honestly think Lattafa made a smart marketing move with the packaging. YouTube & TikTok did the rest.\n\nSo, I\'m not getting a Killian, but what I dó get – save the sometimes issue with the tuberose – is a wonderful set of spicy and mature gourmand sweet accords with a coconutty-date heart that\'ll be great on anyone and everybody. As long as you like smelling like a snack.\n\nWhile Khamrah unfolds and follows different steps in the pyramid it\'s in many ways pretty linear. The first whiffs are a good indication of what you\'ll keep. You\'ll just get a tad more sweetness from the very edible heart and a vanilla-warm-woody base to have both a longer lasting effect and depth. That spicy cinnamonroll/gingerbread opening stays with you - though in a more subdued way.\n\nProjection and sillage are moderate. Longevity is ...hours. And hours. Which came as quite the surprise. My skin doesn\'t project and “eats perfume”, making beastmode fragrances and very longlasting scents a near impossibility. Khamrah does it though. Even a first test with one spray on the top of my hand stayed for 8 hours. A full wear remained even longer and kept a moderate projection quite constantly. I\'ve not tested on clothes, as I rarely do so, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if that would result in a 24h+ wear.\n\nKhamrah is whatever you want it to be, but I assume most people\'ll wear this fragrance in the colder months of the year. It is also when it performs best, though I have worn it to bed in Fall and cooler Spring days.\n\nAll-in-all: while the original reason for the hype is weak (dupe), many have definitely, accurately designated Khamrah\'s worth. The fragrance can measure itself with scent and quality against a niche caliber juice and come out, if not on top, then certainly holding an award for “Best Middle Eastern Gourmand of 2022 with excellent marketing”.\nNB* I\'ve tested several dupes/inspired by Angel\'s Share and am considering a short blog describing them all.', 'Today I evaluate once my latest acquisition. I was able to test the ""Khamrah"" now for 2 days and must now simply give my two cents.\n\nIn short: It was love at first ""Sniff""!!! Me envelops a breath of Christmas market - and although the season has not yet started. A scent of warm apple strudel and baked apple embraces me. Based on this, I must note that I would rather not wear this scent on a summer day now. In the autumnal ""dirty weather"", however, he fits perfectly.\nI do not feel currently in a position to wear another fragrance.\nAbout the durability, I can say that he holds about 6-8h on the skin with me. On my clothes I perceive him longer. The sillage is extremely strong at the beginning, but falls off with time.\nGenerally, he holds but a working day well through. Who still wants to the ""after-work party"", can like to re-spray.', '... can be quite helpful! At least that\'s what I discovered when I enriched my personal Parfumo series with a repeat of the ""Angel\'s Share"" episode and the ""Khamrah"" episode, which had been removed from the program...\nI was very fascinated by the bottle and the notes of Angel\'s Share shortly after it was released - and by the fragrance too. So soft, so round, so elegantly alcoholic... Unfortunately, I got tired of the fragrance shortly afterwards. And sold it again. So far, so good.\nOn one of these days, when I was tired of making decisions - decision fatigue, I read, is a symptom of my job, in which I make up to 1,500 decisions a day - and lolling listlessly in front of YouTube, I saw a video in which Angel\'s Share was very much slated. Because I think so little of the source of this channel, this video almost challenged me: ""Bad? Okay. I\'ll watch it again.""\nUnfortunately, I found Angel\'s Share quite expensive. And THAT was the moment when Khamrah appeared on the scene. Enthusiasm! Great bottle! Great pyramid! Great comments! And a wonderful prize!\nKhamra quickly moved in with me and I thought I now had my Angel\'s Share back. But unfortunately that wasn\'t the case. I was so bitterly disappointed. Khamrah is, as many write here, really a fragrance in its own right. But I don\'t think it needs to hide behind Angel\'s Share. I don\'t get on well with it. I do perceive the subtle spicy tones, but there is something so harsh, dull and dark in the background that I find it rather unpleasant to wear after a short time. I don\'t find this harshness masculine at all, that\'s not the problem. It\'s just that I find the fragrance relatively flat, it doesn\'t go into depth, doesn\'t spread out in developments, doesn\'t lead along winding paths to drydowns that surprise, but remains very linear and very intense in my eyes, and that builds up in front of me like a wall that is simply too powerful for me. In my opinion, the fragrance lacks the softness that makes it possible to wear spice fragrances at all. I don\'t eat cooking spices on their own, a teaspoon of cinnamon or even nutmeg would be extremely unpleasant (and probably also very unhealthy). For me, spices need to be integrated into a soft, restrained base, to which they add the finishing touch like diamonds to an elegant, simple dress. They have to make the base sparkle, and they must not appear pure. One idea I like about Khamrah is the smell of warm apples with a slight acidity, such as Boskoop, associations with warm apple pie. But in Khamrah, this note overwhelms me, as if the apples were not embedded in soft, tender, buttery shortcrust pastry, but in fresh concrete. Khamrah is therefore not the right fragrance for me. And so, in the end, my path led me back to Angel\'s Share, which I won\'t give away again and won\'t share with any angels.', '... the time will come when I can finally unpack Khamrah again!\n\nIf you\'re as perfume-crazy on TikTok as we are here, I think Khamrah is really hard to pass up in the long run.\nI\'ve had it for a year now, when it was still rare at times, so I ""had"" to buy it blind. Was it worth it?\n\nIf you\'re looking for a 1:1 dupe of Angels\' Share, you won\'t find it here in my opinion. The vibe is similar. Okay\nBut for me, Khamrah is a completely independent fragrance with a unique, WONDERFUL DNA.\nGood - and the bottle would work.\n\nKhamrah opens incredibly warm for me. Delicately spicy - not masculine-dominated spicy! - and cinnamony. Pleasantly sweet. There are many fragrances that are sweet and become unpleasant. With Khamrah, I don\'t feel that at any time. If I sniff VERY intensely, I can actually smell a tiny bit of tuberose. But it seems a little lost among the spices. However, I don\'t detect an apple note at all. Personally, I would rather associate it with fresh, still warm cinnamon buns. Dates. Roasted almonds. Wintertime or cold fall. It pushes aside any winter depression and brightens up any gloomy day.\n\nH/S are incredibly good. It fills rooms (for me) and receives endless compliments.\n\nFor value for money, (once again) the packaging, the heavy bottle: absolute go!', 'People who think that this isn’t worth up to $150, either don’t own any single niche fragrance, and hence, prejudiced, or they’re just complete biased haters, that have this illogical and wrong view on Lattafa, prolly because they do clones. And here lies my problem with society—the inability to judge things, open-minded!\nBut I digress.\n\nKhamrah opens up with sweet mix of dates, wine accord, cinnamon and something coconut-y. I do get a kind of woody/leathery vibe in the background. It progresses over time and loses that dates smell and becomes kinda balsamic and woody; with vanilla, Tonka bean(also detected in the opening), woods and myrrh being the star here. I don’t wanna go in depth on the smell, as it’s still new to me and many people have already done justice to that.\n\nThe performance on this, is mind blowing. Put this on my arm, an hour later, I took a nap and woke up 2 hours later and was like “Jeez, what’s this beautiful aroma?”, then I realized I sprayed Khamrah... and lo and behold, it was just as if I was just spraying it. It’s just too strong and loud. I just got it and It’s been 5-6 hours now and it’s still loud.\n\nEven tho I know quite some things, I’m still not a big fragrance expert, but I can tell you that I have smelt heavily synthetic bad fragrances that costs over $25, but this is just as smooth as hell. This is beauty personified, and I’ve used and tested hundreds of Lattafas. If you think that most Alharamain Amber Oud range is okay for over $80 for 70ml(I think), and this is too much for the $65+ for 100ml it’s going for, then you’re biased. This is the exact problem I had with a reviewer that said Roja Apex is like the ‘niche version’ of Sauvage elixir... WTF! Just because it’s Roja doesn’t make it any better!!!!!!!! Fraghead(most especially the niche snobs) should stop these irrationalities!', ""Khamrah is not a fragrance, it is the absolute power you can wield in your hands. Sniffing it for the first time, I was completely blown away. Transport yourself to a world of sensation and depth of fragrance with just one puff. A very unobtrusive bergamot opens perfectly in the head note leading it's way to the good booze - a very balanced sweetness combined with a creamy alcoholic note and cinnamon gives a sense of immense luxury. The great complement to this fragrance is date and praline, doing the atmosphere of an expensive gourmand wrapped up in 24 karat gold. In the end we are led into the bottomless abyss by myrrh and vanilla, making both an indispensable base scent for icy days. The perfume is decidedly unisex, with no emphasis on either side. If you want to dazzle those around you and receive a wave of compliments, this is the fragrance you should choose without hesitation. The longevity is very strong, after using the perfume you can smell for up to several days on your clothes. There is absolutely no need to reapply during the day, unless you want to smell even more intense. The bottle itself is very well made and the packaging is stunning. The Lattafa brand has once again done a great job. Something so well composed for such a small price is something you don't come across everyday. If you can get your hands on it, buy it."", 'After all the ""hype"" I wanted to try this fragrance too. Now I\'ve bought it too. The perfume blew me away after the first spray! A very beautiful and sweet fragrance, which is perfect for the winter and Christmas season. The durability as well as the sillage is very good for this price. The perfume goes in the direction of ""Emporio Armani Stronger with You Intensely""\n\nConclusion: I would definitely recommend the fragrance to anyone who likes winter perfumes and who also likes the oriental/sweet direction. The price is around 40€, you can\'t go far wrong with it!', 'I really like the scent, its amazing for the price and quality. Amazing performance, i smell it for like 3-4 hours in the air quite strong, after that it starts to settle down, but i can still smell it on me for 8 to 10 hours. I also got some compliments by my co-workers. In conclusion i recommend this perfume.', 'I have seen on Tiktok constantly as many Lattafa fragrances were hyped, including Khamrah. The opinions on Parfumo were divided therefore I have bought me first a bottling.\n\nTo me: I generally do not like very loud and penetrating fragrances that could possibly disturb my fellow human beings.\nNow to Khamrah:\nI sprayed the sample on a strip and the first thing I smelled was quite a lot of spice and a strong woody smell. No date, no cinnamon, no bergamot, no vanilla...\nOnly strong spicy smelling (in my mind wet) wood.\nI smelled it again after half an hour and was very disappointed. It did not smell like a delicious vanilla baked apple fragrance as others described it.\n\nThen I thought ""that can not be"" and sprayed the fragrance on my wrist..\nThe first minutes smelled the fragrance again like wet spicy wood (@Bianca78 wrote ""Grandma\'s old wooden cabinet"" which it meets perfectly) BUT THEN IT PASSED.\nOn my wrist, the scent started to develop sweeter. The spice was still there, but wasn\'t the sole focus. There was a very delicious sweetness to it, which harmonized very well. The scent suddenly became so pleasant. I smelled the dates, tonka bean and vanilla out so well, which now made the scent a creamy, spicy and VERY DELICIOUS scent. I had to keep smelling my wrist because it smelled incredibly delicious.\n\nMy conclusion:\nI like the fragrance extremely well and I can imagine him in the cold winter very well. He is very warm through the spice and has a syrupy sweetness through the dates, in addition he also smells something boozy (like rum). In the drydown, the scent becomes very pleasant and smells like a delicious cuddly scent to me. Somehow this fragrance also stimulates my appetite.\nThe sillage is rather medium and makes it wearable in everyday life (if you do not overspray him).\nI\'m looking forward to use up the bottling and possibly order me a bottle.', 'Christmas last year - my boyfriend gives me Khamrah by Lattafa, and I can\'t wait to try it out. My first fragrance from Lattafa and immediately so confused. What is that? My first thought: ""Oh God no... that\'s not me!"" I don\'t recognize myself. Unfortunately, I have to give it back to my boyfriend because it suits him. Sometimes it\'s like a striking color. Although you admire it on others, you know it doesn\'t suit you. I think because I was somehow told that, being blonde, I should only wear flowery, fresh fragrances, it threw me off track.\n\nFor me, the initial notes are characterized by cinnamon and a hint of brandy. Then everything thickens a little, the dates enrich the fragrance and it becomes rich and dark. A scent like from a café that sells specially spiced pastries during the Christmas season. You wait excitedly at the counter and take in everything around you. It smells of cinnamon, chocolate and cake. A cinnamon bun with apples is the order of the day. If you want, you can get a hot chocolate with cinnamon. After all the excitement in the café, you sit down, a candle burns next to you and you get used to all the sounds and smells. It gets cozy, and the candle smells of vanilla and faintly of wood. It\'s homely.\n\nI really have to thank Lattafa, because little by little I\'ve been venturing into Beast Mode fragrances like this. It was almost an awakening of oriental, powerful perfumes. I can\'t imagine my collection without this treasure. My boyfriend and I have to share it because now he doesn\'t want to give it up either. I have received sooo many compliments and just feel comfortable and magical when I wear it.', 'I don\'t know the AS but through most digital media and this site you have to stumble across this fragrance at some point, which is often compared to the AS.\nThe components sounded interesting and the many reports made me curious, so I got myself a sample (the low price convinces you very quickly).\nThe first impression after spraying it on is sweet, very sweet. I only detect cinnamon minimally and briefly. A slight sweetness remains the whole time, which is joined by a rather artificial vanilla note with a ""buttery"" aroma. I can\'t describe it any other way.\nThe fragrance is very present at first, but I don\'t have this extremely long-lasting fragrance experience.\nFor the price, you certainly can\'t go far wrong but I would recommend a small sample before buying. Even though the fragrance is stated as unisex, I personally see it more on women.', ""Batch 05/2023. This scent, is otherworldly. This is WAY different then Alexandria BFL which is supposedly one of the best clones of Amgel share. Still I haven't smelled KAS, but this is absolutely insane! You get a soft floral, woody, creamy BOOZY scent. The floral is apparent, and compliments the warm cinnamon booze OUTSTANDINGLY. This is a top frag, imo. I just sprayed 30 mins ago, so no talk on longevity or sillage, but the sillage is there for 30 minutes at least. Huge sillage too. Amazing stuff. For 40$ you will NOT find a better scent!!!!"", 'Well, the fragrance could come from an angel, and it\'s not only here that a similarity to Angels Share is drawn.\nBut what Angels Share does in Boozyness, Khamrah tackles differently with a date-like, almost ""Christmassy"" spicy note - and I like that. Here, you don\'t have the feeling that you\'re smelling too much mulled wine, but rather as if you\'re enveloped in a cozy, sweet olfactory mantle.\n\nThe longevity is also great: it\'s not incredibly penetrating for going out and after a few hours it settles in so close that it\'s still perfect for cuddling.\n\nFor this price, definitely a no-brainer for fall and winter, neither man nor woman can go wrong.', ""I bought this fragrance blindly after reading a few reviews of Lattafa-Khamra. I didn't have a hard time with it because the price of 30 euros for 100ml doesn't involve much risk.\n\nThe perfume arrived and I was totally delighted with the presentation, as you would expect from our Arab friends. The box is very high quality and the bottle, of course a cuboid Angels Share bottle, looks very nice and high quality.\n\nNow let's get to the fragrance, I sprayed the stuff on the back of my hand and for the first 10 seconds I got an alcohol sillage around my hand, I had expected this as this is often the case with cheaper perfumes.\nAbout 10 seconds later I had a wonderful delicious scent. Dates, cookies and honey, everything imaginable in this direction, but also a bit of boozyness, which is much more dominant in Angels Share, was in the air. The fragrance is very strong and has a strong sillage and is very well received by people around you, definitely a compliment magnet. Unfortunately, this fragrance hardly has any noticeable development, but that's not a bad thing, this fragrance is ridiculously strong for this price, Lattafa could have charged a few euros more. A great companion for the winter, super delicious, very often I applied this fragrance to my hand just to be able to smell this delicious scent while working, this is also due to the fact that you have a great tendency to become smell-blind with Khamra, which should not irritate you in any case because this fragrance is clearly perceptible and has a super sillage. Overall a perfect, evening fragrance for fall and winter, a super strong buy."", ""As a fan of Angels' Share, the hype surrounding the Khamrah has of course not escaped me. And for the price, you can't really go wrong. But what the fragrance has to do with Angels' Share is still not clear to me. My passion for gourmand fragrances is just as great as my passion for sweet fragrances. Despite this, I couldn't quite make friends with Khamrah.\n\nKhamrah is definitely an attention magnet, how could it be otherwise with such an obtrusively over-the-top perfume. Fortunately, the penetrating, exaggerated sweetness, which I find unpleasant, recedes in the drydown. What remains is a less exaggerated sweetness and the gourmand character breathes a sigh of relief.\n\nHowever, the fragrance is too flat and somewhat synthetic for me; it lacks dynamism. And if I had to smell this scent on someone all the time, it would be more headache than pleasant."", ""Had tested a sample of the Angel's Share months ago and so came across the Khamrah of Lattafa. Tjo, and here is now my review.\n\nFrom the first spray, I felt transported to a sweet, smoldering oriental dream. Dates, really sugary sweet dates, framed by intense vanilla and a vibrant hint of cinnamon. So you must be into sweet stuff otherwise better stay away from this right away! After the first opulent sweetness settles a bit, the fragrance becomes woodier and more mysterious, with this warm, almost soothing note, but never completely displaces the sweet tones.\n\nThe sillage? A beast! You'll be smelled before you enter the room. And the longevity is impressive, it sticks to you all day and beyond.\n\nOf course there are some parallels to the Angel's Share by Kilian, but then the Khamrah is its own thing. Sweeter, not boozy and overall different. Find both good!\n\nIn a sentence: for the price it is worth a try, but beware of a blind purchase if you are not the biggest fans of intensely sweet, opulent fragrances!"", ""And as the title might suggest, we are heading in the direction of the Kilian Angels Share.\n\nATTENTION: We are talking about the direction & not a 1:1 dupe.\n\nMany will probably have become aware of this fragrance as a dupe or imitation of the well-known Kilian perfume.\nI can tell you straight away, it's not the same fragrance & yet it shines!\nHow do you ask yourselves?\nI'll explain it.\n\nThe DNA is clearly the same or very similar, it's supposed to be a gourmand - so a fragrance that I personally would not only smell but also eat.\n\nThe difference to the much more expensive cousin is the unbeatable price (approx. 40-50€) & the fragrance notes. This one is much lighter and generally gives me baked apple vibes the first time I spray it on. That means the sweetness of the date, praline and yes, some cinnamon can be smelled right away. The vanilla is also definitely present in the undertone.\n\nI personally can't smell the bergamot, so no fresh kick.\n\nIn the end, the Khamrah sticks sweetly to you & everyone who hugs you will definitely notice it. But it also means that it is not so penetrating. Others may only notice it directly in front of you. I myself have been smelling it permanently on myself since this morning.\n\nSo if you don't mind the lasting sweetness & you wanted something along the lines of Angels Share, but the price was the catch, you can confidently buy the Khamrah, at 40€ you can't go wrong."", 'I ordered the fragrance blind.\nA real bargain at 40 euros for 100 ML and great for winter.\n\nThe fragrance reminds me of a Christmas baked apple with cinnamon, covered in melted praline. You have to like sweet scents.\n\nBrutal longevity with strong sillage. Seductive and suitable for the masses. Top for the price.', 'For me, a perfect symbiosis of baked apple paired with cinnamon and honey.\nThe durability and sillage surprise me every time. It literally sticks to the skin and clothing. Even after 3 days where you had already forgotten that you had sprayed the jacket with it, you are immediately reminded of it again.\nMy go-to fall/winter fragrance! Just reminds you of Christmas and a good time with your loved ones.', ""My impressions:\nBaked apple, sweet, roasted almonds, cotton candy, gourmand.\nLittle fragrance progression, but extremely delicious throughout! At the beginning, I notice a minimal synthetic off-note from time to time, but really minimal.\nSo minimal that I almost didn't want to tell you.\nIt may also be due to the form of the day.\n\nPurely in terms of presentation, of course, an Angels' Share clone. In terms of scent, I don't necessarily think so, although the two are very similar.\nWhere Khamrah focuses on the sweet apple, the competitor focuses on cinnamon and vice versa.\nAlthough I must confess that I only own one bottling of Angels' Share.\nHowever, I would definitely also give it a certain boozy note!\nIt's obviously perfect for Christmas markets, Christmas parties and the entire Advent season.\nOtherwise also very versatile to wear if you don't overdo it with the quantity.\nDefinitely unisex.\n\nConclusion:\nAs known from many Lattafa fragrances, the price / performance of this representative is of course top notch! That's not the only reason why I always reach for the bottle, I like it! Nevertheless: Attention, very sweet...\nPackaging / presentation: Full marks, you could easily pay 5 times the price for this! Would - and will - clearly prefer it to its relatives (from Kilian)!"", ""Wow...\nI was afraid that this perfume again like the oud stories of Lataffa before Lauter oud and patchouli nothing else is perceptible and is much too coarse.\nBut I was in love from the first second.\nThe fragrance is not as loud as the above fragrances. He is quite perceptible and present but not intrusive and annoying.\nHe smells delicious and unique.\nIt definitely reminds of autumn and winter. Like a delicious Christmas scented candle only as a perfume.\nIt smells like Christmas cookies but pleasantly wearable. I'm not really a fan of smelling like food but it's really warm and nice.\nHe warms the heart when one is cold.\nFor everyday life suitable, work I do not know but evenings definitely also.\n\nCinnamon, nutmeg, spicy strong praline. A little sweet but spicy at the same time. The vanilla makes it warm.I'm not disappointed I'm so glad to have bought him yet after much deliberation. And the packaging and the bottle ... you just have to leave it there as a display."", ""I bought it because everyone was comparing it to Angels Share, but it's not. The only similarities are the gourmand vibe and the bottle.\nThe fragrance is really cool and I mean really good very good indeed. The perfume starts directly with the praline sitting on the date with some cinnamon on top. It's really, really delicious. Then comes vanilla which plays together with the tonka bean. The scent in general is sweet but not overpoweringly sweet that you get tired of it, it's really well rounded and fun to wear. It is a light sweetness, you could also say transparent sweetness, because it mixes with a light freshness that I unfortunately cannot describe\nThe presentation is simply top, so it couldn't really be better and the bottle itself looks really great. However, you have to make compromises with the lid because it's really weird to close and the sprayer is really very weak but it does its job.\n\nThe durability is above average. You get at least 8 hours of the perfume on the skin and also several days in the clothes. The perfume has a very good sillage, you are often asked about it and you notice the smell again and again.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this perfume. Whether you are a man or a woman, the fragrance suits both very well. An absolute unisex with a top price-performance ratio."", 'So far in my 2 years or so of my fragrance journey, and having sampled approximately 500 different fragrances, this is #1 for me in terms of the best value of any fragrance so far. Another reviewer described it as ""Christmas in a bottle"", and I couldn\'t agree more. While it\'s decidedly NOT a clone of Angels\' Share, I\'d say this is almost an ""inspired by"" fragrance with a holiday twist. My batch is full of booze and cinnamon, and while I don\'t get as much of the dates/praline as others have mentioned, it\'s just as delightfully rich, deep and complex as any By Kilian fragrance, even Angels\' Share. I got mine for $30, and I simply cannot believe that such a high-quality fragrance could be had for such a low price. Utterly amazing.', ""After Interlude, Khamrah was the second fragrance that hit me like a nuclear bomb. You know immediately that this is something special. And every time you smell it again, your desire for a bottle grows. The benchmark for outstanding perfumes. As soon as your desire for a bottle grows, you know you've hit the jackpot again. This doesn't happen too often, but that's a good thing, because it has to remain something special.\n\nThe Khamrah came as a small bottling from my brother-in-law. It was so delicious, I would have loved to drink it. Something like a brandy, cognac-like, gourmand. It was the fall of '22 and there was already a little hype about it in the perfume world, it was nowhere to be found. If it was available online for a short time, you had to be quick, it was immediately out of stock again.\n\nThen I had it in December. A beautiful presentation, a great presentation, in which a high-quality, beautiful, cognac bottle-like flacon is set against a quasi-mirrored background in a wood-like box. And something in this price range. Compliments.\n\nWhen you wear it, you stand out. You'll be talked about.\nH/S at the top level.\nOf course it's a fall/winter fragrance, but I also wear it in other seasons because I would miss it otherwise. From 25 degrees onwards, however, it becomes too heavy and not only overwhelms you, but also the others.\n\nIncidentally, the fragrance pyramid on lattafa.de differs slightly. Unlike the pyramid published here, it lists cognac, among other things.\n\nI would currently call it no. 3 in my ranking."", ""Very disappointed. After all the mega enthusiastic reviews and videos I thought that was now my winter Christmas fragrance. But nope. First of all. The packaging is mega elegant. The bottle also. Only the plastic lid is a little stupid and does not go grad easy to.\nThen you spray. In the first seconds quite nice. Like an apple strudel that you have soaked in cognac or whiskey. Then ne quarter hour later, the arm smells like grandma's old wooden cabinet. Again a little later, it suddenly smells again slightly like apple pie, this time with some cinnamon in the cognac. This goes back and forth for a while and then everything is gone. In the meantime, I think it's me. Well. \u200d️ Does not last long. Stinks more than it smells and from the ingredients I can hardly recognize one."", 'The perfume Kamrah is truly a masterpiece in my opinion ( considering the low price well understood). Those who are not willing to pay the price for the Angels Share and are looking for a cheap alternative, but are well served by this.\nUnlike the Angels Share, however, a boozy rum note is completely missing here. So , Well enough of the comparison of two completely different fragrances.\n\nKamrah presents itself as a completely independent fragrance that takes you into a world of oriental dried fruits, seductive dates and a good pinch of cinnamon. This fragrance profile inevitably evokes memories of the magical winter season, where warm and sensual aromas play a special role.\n\nKamrah is a fragrance that seems like a poem of winter that envelops all those who wear it in the cold season. Its depth and complexity give it a magical aura, reminiscent of snowy landscapes and cozy fireplaces without reeking of smoke. Kamrah is undoubtedly an olfactory journey into the fairy-tale world of winter.\n\nI think Kamrah remains a faithful companion for several hours, even in cold weather, and I am confident that it will survive even a long evening at the Christmas market.', ""After hundreds of reviews and explicit recommendations on Tiktok and YT, I decided to buy the fragrance and was extremst gespannt.\nİch had always wondered how gourmandig and delicious should be taken up, which I had always read in reviews.\nAnd when the fragrance arrived, I finally understood what delicious could mean.\nMy father sprayed himself first. It was just to bite into, absolutely delicious. Really reminds you of a winter's day - you smell cinnamon, apple pie, vanilla (it kind of reminded me a bit of baklava şerbet - just seductive) - generally sweet yummy notes, but they are anything but strong and annoying.\n\nI absolutely loved the scent, but my problem with Khamrah is the longevity. İch could not even a whole hour the fragrance strongly perceived. Everything after 20 minutes were only so light perceptions.\nAfter 3-4 hours on the skin actually almost nothing.\nSillage was strangely enough on the skin of my father mega blatant. İch was positively surprised, what a broad scent cloud it leaves behind - I was in love. But with me max. 3/10.\n\nGenerally, therefore, very nice fragrance, with poor durability and also relatively weak sillage.\nContrary to all the reviews, the performance was with me so not so good, unfortunately. I try the fragrance also times with Vaseline."", ""In my search for a really sweet, gourmand Christmas fragrance, I inevitably stumbled across the recommendation for Khamrah. The descriptions of a cinnamon-praline Christmas market dream made me curious - that sounded exactly like the scent I was looking for! When it finally arrived, I was almost excited. Then the first spray and...confusion. Then disappointment. The one on my wrist didn't smell like Christmas and gourmand comfort at all, but more like an unspectacular, almost pretentious men's perfume. I blame the bergamot in the top note for this, as it inevitably reminds me of Dior Sauvage in every fragrance - and I really don't like it very much. So it's a purely personal problem on my part. I couldn't perceive cinnamon and nutmeg in the opening at all.\n\nSo I waited. And it was worth it. Within minutes, the fragrance transformed on my skin, becoming sweeter and softer. The jostling, synthetic-macho quality gave way to a cinnamon-sprinkled date praline on vanilla pudding. Gentle, sweet and almost sticky, without making you sick. There was also a certain fruitiness, the scent was reminiscent of a Christmas market - but also somehow of the confectionery department of a luxury department store at Christmas time: chocolates, fruit confectionery and spiced cookies. The vanilla makes its presence felt on the finish: it is clearly perceptible after a few hours of wear and dominates.\n\nLongevity is really good (still absolutely perceptible after 8 hours of wear) and it also radiates without being overpowering - but I think you should spray with caution.\nI am positively surprised by this blind purchase, but it should be mentioned here that it really is a unisex fragrance that is slightly masculine.

It is definitely perceptible for a relaxed 8 hours, which is longer on clothing.\nA clear recommendation from me!', ""I've had the Lattafa Kamrah for 3 days now and spray it on every day.

It starts off very, very sweet - stays that way until the end, just a little less sweet. The start is still not my thing, but as soon as the heart note appears, the Kamrah is really, really good and has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances - at least for the winter.\nSince the fragrance is really sweet, I think it's more suitable for fall/winter. Maybe spring in the evening, but less so in summer. Although vanilla is apparently present in the base note, I notice this flavor very early on - which is an absolute plus for me.\n\nI can imagine the perfume on women and men, in my opinion it suits both equally.\n\nLongevity and sillage are very good - you can feel it all day long, beautifully enveloped in a sweet, feel-good cloud.\n\nThe bottle is beautiful and solid. The lid, on the other hand, is cheaply made and the atomizer is not my thing: doesn't spray as nicely and in too narrow a stream.\n\nI'm amazed at the quality, especially as I only paid CHF 60 for it - I have other fragrances that are far more expensive and give less - be it the fragrance itself, the durability or the sillage.

I imagine a beautiful house in the woods surrounded by snow, coming in to a warm, loving home with the fire on and the feeling of someone being there happy to see you as you are to see them.

It can be hard to get because of its popularity and when you first get it, it does need a little time to become it's full potential, but once the kinks are worked out it becomes something so beautiful that you don't want to run out of it ever. Like a blossoming love that when done correctly becomes something truly wonderful to experience. The perfumer creating this definitely knew what they were doing to make such a wonderful fragrance at such a price, which was about £40 when i bought it.\n\nIf you can get this fragrance, or it is hard to get where you are, I suggest putting it on some sort of alert when it is back in stock because this is one worth the wait and when you get it you will understand why and not want it out of your collection ever again.\n\nThis definitely up there in my top list of the best fragrances i own.\n\nI almost forgot to mention just how beautiful the bottle and box it comes in.

No need to be spraying this on the wrists to check every so often, you are aware of it all day, and this is not a fragrance i find so strong to the point i become nose blind from it.\n\nIt is a great winter fragrance, but you can wear this all year round, as the sweetness is not too overpowering and feeling like you are drenched in some sort of syrup poured over you at a drunken party.

For winter / fall top fragrance"", ""I bought Khamra because it is often compared to Kilian Angels Share. I personally think that Khamra has a very unique note but definitely goes in that direction.

For me, it smelled like a spicy apple juice right after I bought it, which I was a bit disappointed about at first.

I am someone who likes to spray more than just 3 times and I bitterly regretted it. It was so strong that even I constantly had a scratchy throat because I unfortunately sprayed too much a few times. For the office or other human-related professions, you should really be careful to only apply 1-2 sprays, of course if you are outside and wearing a thick jacket underneath anyway, 3-4 sprays are also fine. The fragrance gets compliments, it is just a very sweet praline / date / apple-cinnamon cake fragrance, someone has already written that it also smells a bit buttery, I can confirm this, as if you would add vanilla sugar to melted butter. I have no idea how you can smell bergamot here. No citrus note perceptible for me. To be honest, I don't know the Killian fragrance and wouldn't want to for the price.\nIf you like sugar bombs, give it a try, it reminds me a lot of Shaghaf Oud in terms of sillage and sweetness. I would rather smell the fragrance on a woman, much too sweet for a man, but even as a man I could get one or two compliments."", ""Wow! That was my first thought when I sprayed Khamrah on for the first time.\nI ordered Khamrah because many people compare it to Angels Share, which I also really like.

The only thing missing is a cup of mulled wine :D\nThe scent immediately starts to take over the room. The sweetness is joined by a somewhat ""boozy"" note, but I can\'t quite put my finger on what it reminds me of. Rum? Apple cider? There\'s something synthetic behind it. Personally, I don\'t detect any myrrh or wood, but if I do, it\'s all suppressed or overwhelmed by this extreme cinnamon-sweet-alcohol combo.\n\nThe fragrance projects so extremely that it is almost somehow unpleasant. It is definitely difficult and somehow really, really heavy. The cinnamon/""booze"" note is definitely present throughout the entire fragrance and hardly gives the fragrance any air to ""breathe"".\n\nAll in all, the fragrance leaves me somewhat perplexed. It\'s not bad in itself and definitely something for winter, but it\'s not really mine. But if you like extremely sweet stuff, you\'ll probably like it.', ""I think Khamrah has some undeniable similarities to Kilian's Angels' Share, but if you're looking for a perfect dupe, you will be disappointed. In my opinion Khamrah is a very nice scent, but Angels' Share is still a bit warmer, rounder, and better.\n\nThey're closest in the beginning, because both start out with a very intense cinnamon note, warm vanilla and fruitiness. While Angels' Share doesn't have any fruit notes listed, it reminds me of dried apple slices. Khamrah on the other hand smells like the listed dates. They both give me a warm, wintery, cozy and snug feeling. And that's where the similarities end.\nIn the drydown, Khamrah doesn't get quite as warm and gourmand as Angels' Share. It's sweet, but it also has strong woodsy notes and a transparent booziness. I can also sense the praline and something vaguely floral, so it has a bit more of a designer perfume feel. The base reminds me a little bit of Kayali Invite Only Amber, it has a similar texture. I do like both of them, but this booziness is not 100% my thing.\n\nSorry for writing more of a comparison instead of a regular review, it's always hard not to do that when something is regarded as a dupe for a more famous fragrance that you also have a decant of.\nAnyways, I think Khamrah is a great choice if you're looking for a warming cinnamon scent and don't want to spend a fortune."", 'On really cold days, when you look at the thermometer and realize: ""oh, today I\'d better put on a thicker jacket"", this fragrance offers everything I need.\n\nSlightly sweetish alcohol note at the beginning, transforms relatively quickly into a pleasant cinnamon note.\n\nVanilla and a warm woody note accompany me in the further course of the fragrance.\n\nIn terms of durability:\n10-12 hours but quite easy (actually a madness for the price).\n\nSillage:\nMaybe next time only 3 sprays (you might smell it at the other end of the aisle).\n\nBut from the feedback, only positive responses.\n\nAn absolute blind-buy in terms of price-performance ratio.\n\nKind regards,\nPlain text', ""The nice thing is that I got it as an Angles Share alternative,\nWithout knowing exactly what Kilian smells like.\nI think the fragrance is mega good.\nI only read very often afterwards that it doesn't smell like the A.S.\nAnd there will be something to it, because the Khamrah definitely does not have an alcoholic note.\nIf you're looking for an Angles Share..... hands off.\nIf you're just looking for something similar that smells great and lasts a long time in winter....\nDefinitely a recommendation to buy.\nIn any case, I'm not sad about having bought it and it doesn't quite come close to Angles Share."", ""Since I've recently become a big fan of gourmand, sweet winter fragrances, and the khamra has been advertised by various perfume influencers as the absolute price-performance champion, I thought it would be interesting to get a sample from the souk. First of all: I know that Khamra is supposed to be a dupe of the Angel share by Kilian, but I have never smelled this fragrance before, so I will now evaluate it as a stand-alone release, regardless of its intention to be a fragrance twin.\n\nIf I had to describe Lattafa's Khamra in one word, it would be: Cinnamon bun. It smells like a warm cinnamon bun that has just come out of the oven. It has an extreme sweetness and the very pregnant cinnamon note extends beyond the opening, more or less over the entire wearing time of this perfume. Personally, I didn't notice much of the somewhat harsher notes listed in the base of the fragrance pyramid. However, as I quickly discovered, this is not for me. I find the sweetness of Khamra so overwhelming that I could hardly bear to wear it for a whole day. It's like real cinnamon buns, which I can only eat in very small doses haha. I can well imagine that people who like very sweet perfumes will find this fragrance extremely appealing, but I have to pass."", ""The perfume gives me full vibes of Kaiserschmarren, with apple mousse and cinnamon.\nAt the Christmas market, of course! Dreamlike fragrance.\nUnfortunately, the fragrance does not fill a room. Silage should be stronger for me.\nUsually the only flaw with Lattafa....\nBut maybe I'm an extreme (as far as the opinion of Silage is concerned)"", 'I´m going to be honest. I think the hype around this fragrance is more so a product of youtube influencers rather than actual merit.\nThis is incredibly synthetic and unnatural in a very very sweet headache inducing way. The main problem is that they compromise the balance of the scent with too much synthetic ingredients because they want to prioritize performance. For the price, I understand that it can be difficult to create a quality scent with good performance, but in my opinion, scent should always come first. To be fair, I´m not the biggest fan of the original AS, because that fragrance itself is quite synthetic and clearly overpriced for what it is.\nAnyways, if you are looking for true masterpieces in this genre that are worth the money I would point you to PDM Oajan or even XJ Naxos.\ndisclaimer:this review is not meant to offend anyone.', 'This fragrance is simply a stunner and bomb for 40€.\nA double whammy, so to speak.\nCardboard-sweet fragrance that surrounds a warm plum/date with vanilla and cinnamon. Somewhere there is still a little alcohol/rum.\nBut where is the bergamot?\nSo for 40€ actually a no-brainer if you like sweet-gourmandy Christmas market (because of this plum/date) scents!', 'Kharmrah is a very sweet and strong unisex fragrance. The packaging and bottle have a very high-quality design and are perfect as a gift.\nAs described above, the fragrance itself is very sweet and heavy, but therefore something for the cold season. It immediately evokes associations with the Christmas season and is reminiscent of the smell of baked apples in the best sense of the word, is sensual and gourmand and has something embracing about it.\nThe following applies to the amount of spray: less is more. In closed rooms 2 sprays are enough, if it goes out into the fresh air you can use one more. As I said, it is an intense and long-lasting fragrance.\n\nAll in all, Khamrah is an absolute no-brainer if you like sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially for the price.', ""At first glance, the Khamrah looks like an Angels' Share dupe.\n\nHowever, the opening of Khamrah is completely devoid of the alcoholic note that makes Angels' Share so special. Overall, the entire fragrance is characterized by a strong sweetness. This makes the fragrance rather one-dimensional, but the sweetness is admittedly also pleasantly heavy and sensual. It is not particularly synthetic either.\n\nThe fragrance is definitely something for the evening or for going out, perhaps also for a date. It needs cold temperatures, otherwise it would really be too much with its heavy sweetness. What's more, the Khamrah also has a feminine twist thanks to this very sweetness, although it is still grown-up.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are very good, especially for the price range in which the Khamrah is found. This also results in a pretty good price-performance ratio.\n\nEspecially for its price, I think you can both try this fragrance and buy it blind if you like very sweet scents."", ""Sugar Orient Bomb\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that I don't know Angels Share by Killian in real life. So I can only give limited information here as to whether Khamra is really Angels Share in Favorable. But let's take a look at this fragrance for ourselves first.\n\nThe packaging is really great. A small display with mirror foil. In the price range 1a. The bottle is very similar to that of Angels Share. Sure, it's supposed to be a clone.\n\nThe community often criticizes the glass bottle but with a plastic cap. Here it should be said that this is not cheap plastic ala deodorant bottle cap, but high-quality plastic.\n\nChristmas market time at the time of the review. Stalls with the smell of sugar and roasted almonds. That's what you can expect at Khamrah.\n\nSweet, heavy. Sweet, but with a certain depth. The fragrance is composed in such a way that although the sweetness and a certain similarity to marzipan is recognizable, it also has depth.\n\nThis sweet praline and honey gorumand vibe is what characterizes this fragrance. Heavy, sweet, but damn good.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are more than good. Absolutely top for this price range. Better dose carefully, if there are diabetics around you, you could get a sugar shock ;-)"", ""When I smelled the Khamra for the first time, I didn't like it right away, it has nothing to do with the Angels Share, for me it is much too sweet an almost pungent sweet so that it is unfortunately almost not wearable for me, durability and sillage are top for the price (as you know it from Lataffa), but the bottle is of weak quality, the lid broke after a few weeks. In conclusion, it has nothing to do with Angels Share and is too sweet for me."", ""I bought the perfume as a blind buy (I know....), but it was a complete success. The top note of the perfume is fruity, in my opinion it smells a bit like sweet (baked) apple, even though it's not in the fragrance pyramid. After a while, it develops into a pleasant vanilla scent. It definitely makes you feel like you're at a Christmas market. I can't say much about H/S yet, as I only got it about 1.5 hours ago and applied it for the first time. For the price, I wouldn't mind a less strong H/S, although according to the other reviews it should last quite a long time. Definitely a buy recommendation for the winter."", ""Omg where do I even begin?? This just smells like the most delicious, sweet yet spicy cinnamon and caramell dessert ever! I weirdly get cinnamon apple pie from this, though this doesn’t have any apple notes in it. I can definitely pick up on the sweetness from the date and vanilla as well as the spiciness from the cinnamon, nutmeg and myrrh. I actually also get a little bit of smokiness in the base, I'm guessing from that roasted tonka bean? It just smells absolutely addicting and super sexy to me with the spiciness and almost a bit leathery! Definitely nothing for the warmer months and also very strong! It literally lasts days if not weeks on my clothes and also has great projection! So, if you don't like sweet and spicy thiccc gourmand scents, stay far away from this one!"", ""Sweet and delicious. Smells of baked apple and Christmas cookies, which makes it very good for cozy winter evenings with the family.\n\nLongevity and sillage are very good, which is not unusual for sweet winter fragrances.\nPrice performance is okay.\n\nThe fragrance is not bad but also nothing special, which unfortunately does not live up to its hype (especially on TikTok).\nKamrah is also not a dupe of Angels Share and doesn't have much in common with it, as many like to claim.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking for a solid winter fragrance for cozy winter evenings, this fragrance is probably the right one for you.\nBut if you want a cheaper alternative to Angels Share, Kamrah is unfortunately not a good choice."", ""I was introduced to this perfume by my brother. He was surprised by the scent himself and had to show it to me. A very sweet, oriental and strong fragrance for fall or winter. It reminds me a lot of an oriental dessert called Künefe. Definitely a must-have for me for special occasions. I'll get it this year.\n\nAbout the fragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a sweet, oriental and cinnamon scent. The cinnamon scent then fades a little and then turns into a vanilla scent. The cinnamon scent clearly dominates. The fragrance reminds me of a dessert called Künefe. I'm sure some of you know this dessert.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a good, strong oriental perfume for special occasions in the fall or winter, you can't go wrong here. For just under 40 euros, you get a super sweet and strong oriental fragrance for fall and winter. Note: For me, the fragrance is strong, so I will wear it for special occasions. But it can also change. You get used to some fragrances.""]"

The scent is sweet-spicy. It is being marketed by LVMH.  ,8.3,1032,['male'],"['Nathalie Lorson', 'Olivier Cresp']","['Sweet', 'Spicy', 'Powdery', 'Woody', 'Creamy']",['Italian bergamot'],"['Chestnut', 'Italian iris concrete', 'Benzoin Siam']","['Indonesian patchouli', 'Virginia cedar', 'Haitian vetiver']",8.3,7.9,7.6,8.1,7.9,1032,936,936,943,892,"['I am lucky enough to be able to enjoy this perfume quite fast after its release and I can say that I smiling and keep sniffing my wrist all the time since I sprayed it this morning.\n\nIt starts very pleasant and familiar, with iris, bergamot and a slight boozy note .. the familiarity comes from the Florentine Iris present in DHP, which has a similar opening. This is for my nose almost identical with DIOR Homme Intense 2017, pre-reformulation version .. less powerful of course, but as intense and beautiful.\n\nThe chestnut and the benzoin, are shy and hide behind the multiple Iris notes but keep the character of the perfume quite romantic and classy. I do not smell any vetiver but there is a beautiful high quality cedar note in the dry down, making it even more classier if that can be possible.\n\nAfter about 20-30 min it becomes a very addictive smell (if you like LVMH Iris scents) which reminds me very much of DHP without the stinky leather, which to be honest it´s a total no go for me.\n\nThis is far from a ""new"" release, but very close to DIOR Homme I/P pre-Reformulation scent DNA. As we know, Givenchy and DIOR are both part of LVMH so for me this is a very smart move from them .. to take over the perfume world with DHP as the Original bad boy, and create a well behaved brother called Réserve Privée and make it a Givenchy.\n\nFor the price, quality and smell .. this is a 9/10 creation. 1 point goes off because it is a copy paste DHP without the leather.', 'Now this smells very nice indeed with the fresh iris in the opening that soon has chocolate facets. The whisky adds a nice subtle dimension to the scent and pairs well with the chocolate tinged Iris.\n\nAs time moves forward the scent becomes woody and nutty from the chestnut. Here it begins to get sweeter and powdery with what smells like a hint of caramel melded with the woods.\n\nI get several hour longevity on the skin and very average projection. Within arms length for the first hour dropping to within half a arms length after. It is a scent that stays close to you.\n\nAll in all a delight!', 'I thought about it for a long time. Should I really buy it? Do I really like it that much? Isn\'t it too sweet for me? And so I sniffed this fragrance again and again, pondered and then ultimately left it on the shelf. Until that one fateful Black Friday. It\'s the year 2023 and, like every year, I see lots of messages about various offers two days before ""Black Friday"". My inner anti-capitalist just wrinkles his nose. ""I\'m not going to take part"" I say to myself. Long story short: I bought it after all. On Black Friday. At full price. And I couldn\'t be happier about this decision. After this far too long intro, here\'s a brief summary of why I\'m so happy with this fragrance.\n\nFlacon:\n\nThe bottle is nice and heavy, slightly rounded as with every fragrance in the Gentleman range and fits well in the hand. I really love the color gradient of the glass from black to brown to transparent. For me, this color gradient makes it by far the most beautiful bottle in the whole range.\n\nFragrance:\nThe fragrance starts with a very present whisky note, which actually reminds me of a nice glass on the couch in the evening. Despite the strong sweetness, the fragrance never becomes unpleasant or pungent, which for me is also due to the beautiful iris and chestnut. Both blend in very well and make the fragrance incredibly soft. In the drydown, it then loses some of its sweetness and becomes woodier without changing its basic orientation significantly. You could say the fragrance is linear. This is perhaps true in comparison to other fragrances, but this simplicity is incredibly fitting here in particular. It seems reduced to the essentials, calm, elegant, serene without the urge to really stand out.\n\nSillage:\n\nStriking is a good keyword. Because if you want to stand out, you can stop reading at this point and look for an alternative. Or keep reading and simply spray a little more. Joking aside, Réserve Privee really doesn\'t have a brute sillage. However, like its aforementioned simplicity, this is what makes it what it is: an incredibly sophisticated fragrance that you don\'t wear if you want to stand out, but rather if you know how to make your fragrance blend in perfectly with the rest of your appearance. If this fragrance were a person, it would be much more Ben Bernschneider than Andrew Tate and since I like the former much more than the latter, I can make this comparison with a clear conscience.\n\nDurability:\n\nThe shelf life of the Gentleman is probably the only point where I really have something to complain about. And even that is complaining at a high level. The fragrance lasts a reasonably long time, but I would still like a fragrance with this rather inconspicuous sillage to last a little longer, because after about 6-8 hours you can really only smell it very subtly. In my opinion, this also distinguishes it from similarly designed fragrances such as Dior Homme Intense (2011). While the latter can still be clearly smelled after 8-10 hours, the Gentleman is more or less just a nice memory at this point. It\'s not tragic, but that\'s also part of the truth.\n\nPrice:\nI don\'t need to say much about the price. For 50-60€, this is pretty much the finest fragrance you can imagine, so the price/performance ratio is almost unbeatable.\n\nConclusion/overall impression:\n\nThe fragrance does a hell of a lot right. If you are looking for an alternative to Dior Homme Intense (2011) with a nice alcohol note, you should definitely take a closer look at this one. For me, it is still a perfect fragrance for fall and milder winter days. Cozy, relaxed and yet classy. What a beautiful creation!', ""This fragrance. It's everything. Beautiful, sexy, dark, alluring, one would even say unisex (makeup purse vibe, maybe more swanky leather vibe from the iris) but don't let that deter you. This stuff is the best scent I've smelled in years. When you wear this, men will be jealous of you. Women will just make a face like you owe them something THEY NEED. This stuff is ALLURING, for sure. You want to make someone look your way? Look no further..."", 'Although I have now been moving for some time in the perfume community and already heard many tips and could gather experience on the subject, I let myself get carried away here to a blind buy. Fortunately, however, this was worth it.\n\nTouted on many channels as the ultimate fall fragrance, the fragrance caught my eye during a visit to a perfumery. Actually, I was determined to buy another fragrance. After this but on the day was not available, is the Gentlemen, influenced by the positive reports, after a short test on the fragrance strip bought.\n\nEnough preliminary skirmish, we come to the most important. How does the fragrance actually smell?\nIn the opening, the fragrance starts with beautiful, warm notes. I find despite the listed bergamot you can not really perceive citric notes. We have here a beautiful iris, which unfolds together with a chestnut note and underpinned by an alcoholic, Boozy note.\nThe chestnut I find very interesting and find that it fits well in the fragrance DNA.\nThe fragrance is rounded off with vetiver and patchouli.\n\nThe shelf life is with me at a good 6-7 hrs.\nThe sillage has enough power that your counterpart perceives the fragrance. But I do not find that it is too strong or almost already slaying.\n\nThe best time to wear the fragrance I see in the coming, cold season.\nHere he can score with his warm notes.\nThe best occasions for the Réserve Privée are dates or evenings with friends in a relaxed atmosphere.\nIn the office, the fragrance will certainly not tick off negatively, but I find for this there are better alternatives.\n\nThe rather dark design of the bottle fits well with the fragrance. Otherwise, the bottle is kept relatively simple. In gold lettering, the name and the Givenchy logo are held.\n\nPrice-wise, the fragrance is currently about 55€ for 60ml, which I think is absolutely reasonable.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThe many recommendations to this fragrance I can well understand. The combination of iris, chestnut and the whiskey note fits really well together. Just the whiskey lifts him again from other fragrances that also work with iris notes, I find.\nA test he is worth in any case and maybe he pulls even in one or the other collection.', 'Finally sampling one of the most recent releases from Givenchy, Gentleman Eau de Parfum Reserve Privee, that’s been understandably getting a lot of positive attention. I’m not deeply familiar with Givenchy in general nor the expansive Gentleman line but I wanted to try this, and I’m glad I did. It smells of a cross between ambery whiskey and powdery leather, and no doubt due to the latter, draws comparisons to Dior Homme Parfum, something that occurred to me upon first spray.\n\nI actually sold my bottle of DHP years ago, since, although it was a great fragrance, its sharp powdery quality meant that I didn’t reach for it often. GEDPRP partially addresses that by being noticeably more blended with a sweet and boozy quality, and a fraction of the powdery leather side of DHP.\n\nIt is, in this way, the best of both worlds, a nod to the sweet while still having some of the powder, and it’s achieved harmoniously. I’m quite pleased with it and would consider buying a bottle, as it also performs pretty well. Also, I can see how it would satisfy some DHP fans while being a bit easier to wear and more fashionable, with its resinous/sweet/boozy side, and more toward the mainstream, while still smelling special, and carefully put together.\n\nIt’s priced at $106/85 for 100/60ml, and is sold on the Givenchy website as well as various retailers.\n\n8 out of 10', 'This is by far the best Givenchy for men since Gentleman Only Intense. Although I did enjoy Boisée. Iris is one of my most adored notes in perfumery. Reserve Privée gives me everything I loved about Dior Homme before the regretful reformulation and extraction of iris. There are many note similarities. Iris (of course), bergamot, vetiver, patchouli. The warmth of Scotch Whiskey and chestnut allows the new Privée to have its own identity. This Gentleman delivers over average longevity, drying down to a smooth, woodsy iris and keeping powderiness at a minimum. In its final phase, it’s a lot like Dior Homme Parfum. So, anyone on the hunt for that rare gem will get a taste of it in Givenchy’s latest Gentleman. This is my favorite launch of 2022 from a designer house. A gentleman with badboy tendencies.', 'In the meantime, after a few years of my fragrance journey, I\'ve become a little wary of designer scents... i\'ve been disappointed too often and too often a big brand has put a big name on a cheap chemical concoction to cash in big time.\n\nBut they do exist... great designer fragrances, where perfumers create a great scent from the given materials with the appropriate time and dedication in a relatively inexpensive setting.\n\nOne of these discoveries is Givenchy. Alongside the equally good Boisé, Réserve Privée is a prime example of a great fragrance for little money.\n\nSimilar to Dior Homme, the main focus here is on iris. This comes through very clearly. This can have slight ""carrot-like"" tendencies in some moments, but this is normal with strong iris.\n\nI only perceive the whisky note as a subtle alcoholic sweetness and in combination with the chestnut, it often reminds me of roasted almonds/ chestnuts from the Christmas market.\n\nFor me, it is a great fragrance for fall and winter and has a respectable longevity and sillage\nFor me personally, it is even a tad better than the Dior Homme and will certainly find its way into my collection one day.\n\nYou may like to get lost in the niche, but every now and then there is still a little designer gem.\nI think we could have one here... give it a try :)', ""I come to the fragrance game from the world of whisky, you see. Therefore I thought this was a perfect match for me. Was I far off? Not by much, but perhaps a little. When I first smelled this scent I suspected that Givenchy was doing things a little differently to others. Granted, at the time I had only smelled like 10 or so popular scents, but they were all extreme opposites to what this is.\n\nOn first acquaintance I wasn't met with a typical flowery bouquet or candy sweetness like so many other top scents, but with a very boozy note - under which traveled a layer that I would assign the mysterious qualities of incense. I loved it. So much so that I thought this would become my absolute all-time favorite signature scent.\n\nI've now worn this scent for the greater part of a month and I think I can finally give a pretty fair evaluation. The boozy note that drew me to this is still what I love most about Gentleman Givenchy Réserve Privée. Unfortunately, this boozy note wears off in the first 4 hours (worn during summer time) and what is left of the scent is probably much closer to the regular Givenchy Gentleman EDP. Which is a lipsticky, powdery, creamy, sweet iris note.\n\nAfter the 4 hour mark it seems to lose its potency & projection and sits much closer to the skin, and I'm left to wonder whether I still like this scent. Without the boozy note it is much more tame. Do I want to be tame? No, so I top it right back up. I top it back up because I do really love this scent. I'm just disappointed that it can't maintain for 10 hours what it does in the first couple of hours of wearing it.\n\nI'm quite happy with this scent. I do however think that the search for my absolute all-time favorite signature scent will have to continue. In the meantime, this will suit me more than fine on my journey through the land of perfumes! Onwards and upwards."", 'That’s what I get here…. And it is GORGEOUS. Such richness and fullness in the way it performs. Strengthen DHI’s projection, leave a little more in sillage, pull back on the lipstick feel, and add a little caramel. That’s what I get from this. You DO feel the Gentleman EDP base, but it does feel like DHI is a close relative as well.\n\nPerformance is also great, I got an easy 10hours on skin. The projection was great for 4+ hours reaching out 2-3ft in radius, and the sillage trail keeps the heads turning in your direction.\n\nIf you don’t like the DHI “lipstick” vibe, you might not like this much, as you WILL feel it here, but it’s much less prominent. I feel more of a toffee/caramel vibe (from the chestnut, I guess).\n\nI also don’t get much of a “boozy” feeling at all. That doesn’t make it smell bad, but it may disappoint someone who was expecting that.\n\nI really like the Gentleman line, and I’m not disappointed at all.', 'Finally sampling one of the most recent releases from Givenchy, Gentleman Eau de Parfum Reserve Privee, that’s been understandably getting a lot of positive attention.

I own Dior Homme Parfum Homme Original, Homme Eau for Men, Prada L\'Homme Eau, L\'Homme Intense, Valentino Uomo Intense... (you get my point) and despute how highly regarded those are in the frag comm none of them are a \'Love\' to me. I find the iris not a little annoying if it\'s too heavy handed, I even sold Narciso Blue Noir Parfum and Prada L\'Homme even though they are both great.\nSo then there is Gentleman Réserve Privée, I was caution about the iris note but on the other hand I\'m a sucker for boozy accords so, Whiskey? Yes, please!\n\nThere was a lot of hype, all youtube reviews praising it unanimously so, it had to be good right? So I jumped at the first deal I found and yes, there is the iris I was dreading but it\'s within a range I tolerate so I wore it a couple of times and I was indifferent about it. I decided to wear it tonight and just as I sprayed it I thought to myself: ""wait, wasn\'t there supposed to be a whisky note in here, where is it?"". I can\'t detect any kind of boozy accord perhaps it\'s me so I came to browse the notes and surprise! There\'s in fact a whisky note declared!\n\nThe fragrance is really nice, there\'s the iris and it\'s quite notable so if you\'re into that note you may love it. There\'s a creamy sweet backbone, like vanilla which is not listed but it makes it very cozy and nice, ideal for date night. There\'s also a lovely nutty feel and some patchouli that makes really makes everything feel complete.\n\nPerformance is really good and perhaps if the whisky was more prominent (too me) I\'d rank this higher. I\'m a whisky guy, what can I say?', ""The moment I sniffed Gentleman Réserve Privée, the image that formed in my mind was crystal clear - a sophisticated gentleman sitting quietly in a lounge with a glass of well-aged whiskey, exuding an aura of maturity and elegance. And with this image, I realized how aptly named the fragrance is - it really is a private reserve for the gentleman.\nBut make no mistake, there is more to it than the inviting, alcoholic whiskey note. The fragrance is underlined by a strong note of iris, which brings a sophisticated, powdery note to the mix. The combination is rounded off with woods and a subtle sweetness. If you've ever tried a fragrance like Prada L'Homme or Dior Homme Intensedann, Gentleman Réserve Privée is your next stop. It's a strong fragrance that is perfect for winter and in my opinion is best suited for men over 40 who appreciate the finer things in life."", 'So many colognes to choose from, and Givenchy has never been a favorite. Strange as this may sound, based upon reviews, I decided to gamble on Reserve Privee. Maybe it’s my Scottish DNA. This scent at first was a double at best, but now I consider it a home run. It’s definitely up there, as it took some time to get used to. It is one of the most addictive, delicious scents that I have, and perfect for fall or winter.\n\nA lot of Givenchy colognes don’t intrigue me. They strike me as “boring and old guy” type of scents. Reserve Privee is fairly mature, so be 25 and above, yet it is one to have in your collection. There’s no cologne that I can think of, that has a more decadent boozy, chocolate, frappe, and iris scent than this. If you’re thinking lipstick type of Iris, this isn’t that, as it’s balanced out with bergamot and vetiver.\n\nBreathing this in, my best guess is projection is decent, but it’s not beast mode. There’s just not much of a scent trail, but women close by have complimented this one a lot. Late last year a romantic weekend, was enhanced by this excellent cologne. She got really into this and more, so for that I definitely got more fond of this product.\n\nThis one lasts 6 to 8 hours. That’s pretty good, but of course it could last a little longer. Yet this is among my favorite newer colognes, as it mixes modern with old school. The first hour or two it really pops off of your skin. 4 or 5 sprays is good to go, and this one whether casual or dressed up works. A very attractive bottle, exceptional atomizer, this is a winning scent that goes well on the colder days and nights.', 'I am by no means a self-proclaimed ""fragrance specialist"" as some people claim to be, but I can only say that I really liked this fragrance, it is a warm winter fragrance that is very sweet but still with a rather masculine note. However, I can also imagine that it is not a no brainer and that many people may not be able to smell this fragrance at all. As some of the previous speakers have already described, the scent sensation is subjective, and I fully agree, for me the fragrance is a good outgoing fragrance that not really EVERYONE wears like Dior Sauvage. However, it should of course also be mentioned that this is by no means a niche, so if you want to smell very ""special"", you should probably look elsewhere :)\nI would describe the scent as something like a sweet whiskey smell (not at all like an alcoholic) with vanilla notes. Please don\'t pin me down though, as I said I\'m not a ""fragrance expert""', ""I tested this fragrance at Müller. At first, it is strongly reminiscent of the original. As it progresses, it smells increasingly chocolaty and very sweet. A slight alcoholic whisky note resonates. Like a mild whisky, reminiscent of Werther's original or cream candy. Unfortunately, it smells a little artificial on my skin as it progresses, somehow reminding me of plasticine.\n\nAll in all, however, a solid fragrance, but you should be into heavy sweetness.\nFor me only in\nRecommended in winter.\n\nShelf life 8/10\nSillage 7/10"", ""This is quite obviously a Dior Homme Intense knock-off. Whether they couldn't or didn't want to make an exact copy, it smells a little different. Homme Intense is clean and confident, while Gentleman is more subdued and scattered, or chill, you could say. It's like a man in a suit vs a man in a tracksuit. The main shortcoming of the scent is that the background is rather dull. A strong boozy note and a sparkling aromatic/bergamot layer make it similar to Bentley for Men. This is a very good perfume, maybe as good as Homme Intense, a bit brighter at the front and more friendly, easier to wear. It stays on clothes for days. One of my favourites for sure.\n\nRead more of my perfume reviews at The Scent Stories: thescentstories.substack.com"", ""The Gentleman Reserve Privee, a great fragrance to look stylish, elegant and also serious without completely emptying your pocket.\n\nWith a great patchouli note, the fragrance can make itself felt a few minutes after spraying. The iris blend makes it and is wonderful.\nThe feedback from outside is always positive.\n\nIn my opinion, not for very young people, it is a little out of place.\nNevertheless, don't generalize and try it out for yourself.\n\nFor me, a strong 7.5/10 in terms of durability and presence.\nI'm used to niche fragrances by now but the Givenchy is just the right P/L!"", 'So views I find the fragrance really very successful.\nThe blend of the whiskey with the woods is really good.\nBut it can be too alcoholic for some people.\nMy problem with this fragrance is unfortunately that I can only perceive it close to the skin after 2 hours.\nAnd it can\'t be due to nose blindness, because my wife feels the same way when I wear the fragrance.\nBut I also don\'t apply 10 sprays, otherwise the alcohol note comes through too strongly.\nHowever, I seem to be one of the very few who would describe the fragrance as ""weaker or short-lived"".', ""Absolutely stunning new fragrance from Givenchy,\nmy favourite fragrance of 2022.\nIt's a men's fragrance. It can be compared to Dior Homme Intense, but this one doesn't have that fruity/sweet depth. DHI is rounder and this one is more direct, if you know what I mean.I would recommend it to men 25+ and this one definitely shines best in the evening/night."", ""This fragrance smells like a winter evening in a bar to me. It's great & smells very strong. It's masculine, but not violent.\n\nYou smell like a gentleman. Something like this was missing from my collection. I often wear sweet and gourmand fragrances, so this is a great and masculine change from my more feminine fragrances.\n\nThe scotch stands out in particular, paired with the Italian bergamot, this fragrance has more depth than initially expected. The sillage is also okay, as is the longevity."", ""This is a Great Fragrance, Modern , Elegant, Classy, Rich,\nRefined, Woody, Floral and Ambery. It was on my radar and I tried it two times, Then I bought it. I'm so happy that I have it in my collection and It should be in every man's collection. It opens up with semi sweet warm spicy and floral notes in the background then dry down is semi sweet Vanilla Chocolate and Ambery. Based on Givenchy official Site There are more notes in this perfume : Benzoin , Rezinoid , Vetiver and Patchouli. GRP is sweet but It is not gourmand, It is very smooth and Soft with Chocolate vibe undertone. GRP has one of the best Dry Down in Men's Perfumes with Powdery Floral notes in Depth, It smells magnificent. This is perfect for the Cold Weather, I really enjoy it and I love it. Longevity is Good. The Art of bottle design especially with Ambery Color is very Unique that There is a Harmony between Scent and Color. Highly recommended.\nTwo Thumbs Up\nBravo Givenchy !\nRating : 9 / 10"", 'When I first tested it, I quickly realized that this perfume would end up at the top of my ranking list.\n\nThe combination of scotch, chestnut and iris is really something special. It gives a feel-good warmth and is pleasantly creamy. Subtle floral, feminine notes round off the otherwise masculine fragrance perfectly. An unforgettable olfactory journey, compliments guaranteed!\n\nAll in all, a perfect fragrance for a stylish gentleman for whom quality is important, who likes to beguile the senses and who is self-confident in the process.']"

The baby cat plays on a velvet blanket and knocks over a small bowl of tonka beans.\n\nIn the opening, the fragrance smells sooo similar to Velvet Tonka , that I assure myself several times not to have grabbed the wrong AF. I actually have both fragrances :)\nConclusion: Opening 1:1 of the Velvet Tonka. The fragrance pyramids of the two fragrances are not 1:1 similar to each other.... now I\'m confused.\n\nTonka, vanilla, marzipan... sweet incense spice!\n\nIn the drydown, it becomes smokier and a bit peppery again. But somehow.... not essential. For me, the twin impression remains to the Velvet Tonka.\n\nIn the further development then comes marzipan. Beautiful. Also here. Nothing new.\n\nAfter 2 hours, it is still beautiful... and still Velvet Tonka.\n\nAlso the durability and sillage is good!\n\nConclusion: a fragrance twin. bdk is according to research appeared 1 year before ysl, consequently ysl has ""stibitzt"".\n\nBasically, I find it a bit of a shame that it is a fragrance twin - the special is somehow lost there.\nI like fragrances in the niche - and higher price segment, which are at most slightly similar, but at all times ""stand for themselves"". No copy.\n\nBoth fragrances it does not need at all, with a purchase I would still advise the 2 to test, since it is here about my very personal impression :)\nAnd then I would- personally take the Velvet Tonka, he was there first and ""deserves"" it in my eyes more to be considered.\nTo all who don\'t care, you can take the one that is the better deal. :)\n\nThe scent is as individual as this review is (not) - only the fact that I tested Velvet Tonka first makes the babycat a copycat for me. I could post the contents of the review to Velvet Tonka as well. Aaaaaber, he still gets its own review.\n\nIs a great autumn-winter fragrance, but there is already from BDK. Therefore, also something deduction in the fragrance rating', ""As someone already mentioned, it's just a full blast of incense. Peppery at the beginning, then comes the incense, and very darkly you can sense some saffron, and then vanilla, which tends to stay in the background. All of this with a very linear progression overall. Be sure to test the fragrance first!"", ""Babycat - what does that make me think of? A small furry creature with big eyes that finds it difficult to control itself. It rolls around and claws the handler's finger in play.\n\nBaby cats are cute! And that's why they can be forgiven for their other sides: they don't always wet the litter, they bite, they climb up your clothes and chew the skin of the person you're with. The watery nose and crusty eyes should not be missing from the list.\n\nTheir smell is not just pleasant either. In addition to the furry, delicate, baby-like cat smell, they bring a hint of cat food with them.\n\nIn this respect, I find the concept of YSL Babycat not entirely coherent. (Whether it would have needed a different name or a different content - it doesn't matter) The fragrance of the perfume is not ambivalent, not awkward, not babyish, not animalistic, not playful. You can smell a consistently pleasing, slightly masculine, vanilla scent.\n\nBut here in detail: the vanilla is always present, but does not play to the fore. It is roughened with pepper and cedar, resulting in a very harmonious interplay. The strong sweetness finds an interesting balance with the hard incense after the top notes have faded. In the end, it is just sweet-gourmand.\n\nI can very well understand the association with melted rubber that someone described. But that's a bit of a mean assessment. Because the intensity of this olfactory impression does not drift off into the unpleasant or synthetic.\n\nPersonally, I'm not so fond of the vanillin note and the very sweetness. The performance of the Babycat struck me as positive and I also liked the development. It's not my taste, but if you like vanilla, you'll like this one.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say anything about price performance, as I'm not familiar with this price segment. An alternative might be the Prada Luna Rossa, which is much cheaper, but in my opinion not much worse.\n\nConditional recommendation - if you like vanilla and don't mind the money."", ""Over 600 fragrance reviews for a fragrance that hasn't been on the market that long and isn't available in every perfumery around the corner? You could really call that hype. One that I honestly can't understand. There are much better and more sophisticated vanilla fragrances, even in combination with incense. Lune Féline EAU DE PARFUM comes to mind spontaneously - without incense, but in a similar vein. Also somewhat similar is Leder 6 by Schwarzlose. I don't want to denigrate the fragrance, but I think that alongside many very positive reviews, there should also be room for a somewhat more neutral opinion.\n\nNow to the fragrance: I would have expected a complex, multi-layered fragrance with a progression. One with a clear sillage, mysterious, heavy and noble.\nWhat I got: Incense, leather and vanilla. No more, no less. No great development, seems a bit cobbled together to me. I'm not a big fan of incense in perfume anyway, if I want incense, I go to the... The vanilla is quite pleasant and somewhat reminiscent of Guerlain vanilla. But the rest of the ingredients don't make it any better.\nI secretly wonder where the baby cat is supposed to be hidden - I suspect it's hiding behind the last pew.\nToo bad, but: Not my business!"", 'Babycat - Misjudged and spurned for over a year because the test card was thrown away too early\n\nI couldn\'t understand the hype at all. Saint Laurent or not (I am a couture dressmaker myself and an admirer of ""Yves"", or rather his style and the ideas behind it). And I certainly don\'t wear a perfume called ""Babycat"" (even though I don\'t have a cat myself). I found the perfume terrible. Headache potential to boot...\n\nBut because of the never-ending hype, I had to try it again this winter, since the release - this time ""properly"", spraying the card properly, in the middle of the living room, leaving it for 24 hours, virtually ""holding out""...\n\nThe first 30 minutes LOTS of incense and a tiny bit of leather. Since I don\'t really know what to do with the church and leather is not my scent at all, even with a lot of ""sweetness"" and ""vanilla"", it\'s usually nothing for me. It\'s also extremely intense - it was just too much of a ""bad thing"" for me and the fragrance was far too overwhelming - but if you give it enough time, after about 30 minutes there\'s a huge turnaround that I\'ve never experienced before: Then it becomes the longer the more incredibly delicious, sweet smoky vanilla! And a little later, a ""burnt plastic"" note is added - I love that!\nSounds incredibly simple, but it\'s not\n\nAnd lasts and lasts... Easily 2 days\n\nAnd now: I really don\'t want to go through the cool season without it!\nActually, I\'ve always said: Make sure you get a sample, especially at such prices, let the fragrance develop fully for 2-4 hours and let it work its magic for 1-2 days - then buy it (or not)\n\nThe whole ""Le Vestiaire"" collection is a dream and looks high quality, whether you like it or not, definitely worth a smell festival!\nTo make up for it, here is my first, very, very honest review. Maybe it will help some of you with the same ""problem"" I had', 'I am the lucky owner of this beauty and unfortunately before getting my perfume I have read a few ""reviews"" about it on Fragrantica or Parfumo .. of course they are mainly unfavorable.\n\nAnd we humans tend to be very easy to influence with visuals or text, therefore my expectations were low .. I was waiting to dislike it.\n\nThen when I got it, with the typical luxurious YSL La Vestiarie presentation, the 125ml version .. I opened it, it was already potent without spraying and two sprays on each shoulder and one on the wrist to see what will it be ..\n\nThis starts very smoky and spicy in the same time, the pepper does a great job and the elemi with its resinous character makes it very mysterious, oriental like.\n\nThen you are hit with the saffron, but not in big quantity .. and a big heart of frankincense, almost reminding me of the Dhofar one from Amouage, very very high quality smelling.\n\nAnd in a few minutes, the awesomeness comes to life .. a vanilla to die for, in the company of the strong smoke and the nicest frankincense you can smell in a non Amouage/OmanLuxury.\n\nProjects like a maniac for 4 hours or more .. then up to 8 hours stays like a skin scent, but so addictive .. so far this is the first scent which made sniff my arms over and over again.\n\nI know Dominic Ropion created Vanagloria too, which is regarded as one of the nicest vanilla out there .. and I do not know the Laboratorio Olfativo creation but if they smell similar like someone said, why is that bad? Ropion created Promise for Malle and Oud Aquilaria for OmanLuxury which are 1 to 1 .. how is this not good, I would ask?\n\nYSL made a good job here, the scent is awesome .. and has nothing to do with the name.', 'Babycat, also known as Copycat, is an exact copy clone of Vanagloria by Laboratorio Olfattivo. Created by the same perfumer (Dominique Ropion) who seems like he used the same formula to gain double money. Since laboratorio olfattivo is true underground niche and youtubers hardly get at that, ysl is easier to hype. I’ll stick with vanagloria. Both are caramelized incense....', ""I didn't have this fragrance on my radar at all, I can't even say why. It just didn't appeal to me, it wasn't my scent - the name alone...well...

I bought into the hype and ordered a sample.

This was on the list; along with six others.\n\nThat list now just those six others.\n\nI don’t get it, I get the hype, I understand that but the level of hype is really unwarranted. I have to think that YSL must have the best PR and marketing team as the last few I have retired from them have been mediocre pongs. I really thought this was going to be difficult decision but it was almost instantaneous.\n\nThe sweetness is very cloying and thick. I can feel my teeth itch from the vanilla; which affects everything else. It gives the leather a stickiness that is not appealing. It’s like someone has left a tub of cheap ice cream to melt over a synthetic leather car seat. I’m not a vanilla fan, if it’s in a fragrance for me to like it; it has to be toned down and dried out. This is all to familiar and part of me was kinda expecting it; “I bet that’s similar to X” And I’m not wrong it is similar to ‘X’.\n\nShane really as I was hoping it would make a great gift to someone really dear and special to me.\n\nOh…custard creams. This makes me think of custard creams. I am not a fan of them.', 'I tested this perfume today at Printemps Boulevard Haussmann in Paris.\n\na magnificent discovery, I was worried before smelling it because I had seen several opinions indicating that it looked like spicebomb.\n\nbut in fact not at all it is a superb vanilla, the worthy successor of magnificent gold in lighter.\n\na masterpiece,u can make a blind purchase with this', 'Babycat is an incredibly polarizing fragrance (especially the release batch), it starts with woody notes and incense, the vanilla gets stronger the longer you have the fragrance on.\nand from the moment the vanilla becomes clear, the fragrance is at its best...\ni have Seldom seen such an incredibly deliciously beautiful vanilla, with the incense combination and the leather it is even more beautiful and thinner, pepper makes the fragrance more special and stronger.\n\nto conclude, if you want to smell good on cold days and just want to smell delicious, you should give this masterpiece a chance', ""The Le Vestiaire - Babycat is a great opportunity to get to know the sweet-smoky fragrance with incense as a base.\n\nThe opening is very peppery, almost a little burnt, as I know it from Armani Privé - Myrrhe Impériale, for example. But it's not too much of a good thing, because the sweetness slows down the fragrance so much that it doesn't just smell like a fireplace. It gradually becomes a little resinous and becomes very vanilla-like towards the end.\n\nThe fragrance is not clearly masculine or feminine. This makes it versatile on the level. It works well in fall and winter as a night-out or evening fragrance. Anywhere else, I would rather use something else.\n\nThe longevity and sillage are absolutely solid for this type of fragrance. It is rather expensive for a YSL fragrance. This is partly due to the fact that it also has a somewhat niche character. However, the price is still okay for what you get.\n\nAll in all, this is a fragrance that you can try out to get to know this scent. Alternatively, to be fair, the much cheaper Replica - By the Fireplace would also be worth a try."", ""I had high hopes for this one because of Dominique Ropion, YSL, and anything feline in general. Oh no....it did not deliver. The vanilla is there, yes, and it's just a basic, warm vanilla to me, but I get nothing feral or feline.

The first was Torino 22, which I thought was okay, but nothing special. Then 21, which is a very popular perfume. It was very pleasant and smelled good, but I didn\'t like it enough... But then I tried Torino 22, which took longer to find, so I tested it last. When I sprayed the fragrance on a test strip, I thought to myself, hm, this definitely smells the best!

Dry down definitely turns to mfk baccard rouge\nBut little different.\n\nI guess need to add this one to my collection olso', 'first of all, Torino 22 is a very beautiful and somewhere also very unique fragrance with a good H/S\n\nif anyone thinks this fragrance goes in a similar direction to its predecessor, they are very much mistaken. torino 22 is not a classic ""freshie"". it captivates with a great saffron note that goes a bit in the Baccarat Rouge direction, which is not to say that it is a copy, but it is unmistakable that certain similarities are present.\nthe eucalyptus in the top note is also clearly noticeable and remains present throughout the fragrance.\nall in all, a great fragrance that lasts all day on my skin', ""Torino22 was my first in the Torino series and immediately my favorite. Sporty yet relaxed elegance with saffron! Bergamot paired with eucalyptus - off the tennis court and into the sauna. A high-flyer that won't let you go. You simply won't want to get out.\nT22 is a long-lasting fragrance that doesn't overwhelm. On the contrary. It makes you curious and you automatically want more of it."", ""Hopefully this gets better with time....but initial impressions.....I'm struggling with this one. I'm getting heavy euchalyptus and herbs, which are a bit over powering for a perfume. It's sorta medicinal. Definitely not a blind buy. I would recommend a tester and also wear it outside in cooler weather, maybe I'll get a better scent profile.\n\nUpdate: After a year or macerating the scent has gotten better, from my perspective. One word, Sweet!""]"

The Isola Blu starts with a nice fresh citrus, without being too boringly fresh. In the dry down, the fragrance develops more and more depth and becomes a bit spicier and even develops a slight woodiness for me. In short, really nice! But for me, it\'s just not worth the money.... According to my nose, it is simply the nobler, more complex and deeper Bleu de Chanel. A good fragrance, no question, but I just can\'t justify paying so much for such a fragrance. For this he blows me by far not enough from the stool.\n\nNor is it a ""summer in a bottle"" scent for me. Due to the spice / depth / woodiness I see him rather in the spring or even autumn, but not on the really hot days. He just does not provide the refreshment that I expect from a summer fragrance.', 'Hello everyone,\n\nnow finally after xx years I have dared to try the wide range of certain fragrances from Roja Dove, the Isola Blu PARFUM and not the Isola Blu, but the old Oligarch and NOT as EDP, but as perfume!\n(There weren\'t many, but I only found this out later)\n\nI had a (there) remaining bottle of the old Oligarch in the perfume version (not EDP) x years ago and I gave it away back then and I still remember very well how I regretted selling it for a long time. (Now I have an almost full one)\n\nWhy did I regret it?\n\nI really liked the consistent and different way. Because he doesn\'t just keep it short with 1,2,3 citrusy notes and with 1,2 flowers like most do (some better and some less good) , but he takes a different approach.\n\nThe second (interesting) back story:\n\nI have heard it this way (several times, let me correct it if it is wrong), the oligarch was no longer allowed to be called oligarch because of the Russia - Ukraine conflict and therefore due to certain ""ambiguities"", therefore he was hired and in his place came the Isola Blu, which was (noticeably) adapted - but more about that later!\nWhat is the old Oligarch (perfume) actually like?\nAt the end of the day, it\'s enough to say citrusy, slightly metallic and insanely complex, but that alone doesn\'t do it justice. We have here a good portion of fresh and fruity citrus in an XXL portion (and that is not an understatement) in a high-quality, beautiful, noble and NOT synthetic vein.\n\nAfter that comes my ""LOVE PHASE"", then something quite crazy happens, the citrus bomb becomes a Reflection Man many, many years ago - in 2015/ 2016 they said something like clean, metallic cold and almost sterile (but in beautiful!) and combination makes it a real masterpiece - so much for the impression and the realization!\n\nThe comparison!\n\nThe back story is well known, now to the Isola Blu. In the course of the adjustment and adaptation according to IFRA, it felt completely renewed and much was replaced and much is now noticeably on a synthetic basis. That doesn\'t have to be a bad thing - certainly not, with an extremely good tuning it can be very good. I don\'t want to (!) say that Roja Dove has done it wrong, but the Isola Blu has a somewhat.... on the one hand, they went the entry-level friendly route and the synthetic notes in the Isola Blu are not mine!\nSo if you do, then use an old Oligarch as a perfume and NOT Isola Blu. A comparison almost borders on an oligarch insult^^.\n\nHow is it received:\n\nMy old oligarch back then as well as my current oligarch from 2021 (one of the last!) are really incredibly well received. Whether women or men in the age range of 20, 40 or 60+, all of them love it!\nWhen and where to wear it?\n\nYes, I could now say office and yes that would definitely fit, but it really always goes and always fits (no matter what season or occasion), if there is still enough of it in the formula as a perfume I would get 10 bottles! That\'s how good I think it is!\nIf I really wasn\'t convinced, I wouldn\'t recommend it to you!\n\nAnd now have a nice day/evening, or whatever you read this review, LG the Benny\n_______', 'I\'ve wanted to try the Roja fragrances for a long time. Or at least a few of them. When I looked at the fragrance pyramids, I kept thinking about what these perfumes must smell like if they have so many different ingredients.\n\nWith ""Isola Blu (perfume) / Oligarch (perfume) | Roja Parfums"", I now know what it smells like. I wanted to try it once before. Back then it was still called Oligarch. The name was quickly replaced. But then I couldn\'t find it again. I probably didn\'t look hard enough. In the meantime, I forgot that I wanted to try this fragrance. But now the time had come.\nThe Isola Blu PARFUM begins with a very fine, not at all pungent, but tangy and fruity citrus. This citrus is the reason why I also find that the fragrance smells a little fruity. In between, it is a little soapy and spicy, but just right. However, it is very multi-layered and becomes a little heavier and also a little sweet as it progresses. Frankly speaking, however, it is extremely difficult to recognize certain fragrance notes. You might think that this fragrance is almost perfectly blended when you think about how many different ingredients are listed here. And you don\'t get the feeling that any two components are clashing and don\'t smell right, nor do you get the feeling that it\'s all too much of a good thing. Because the fragrance is not overpowering. It is still pleasantly gentle.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that it has little power. Its longevity and sillage are very good for a fresh, citrusy fragrance. It wears well in spring and summer, preferably on a man. I also find that it can be worn almost regardless of the occasion. I could even imagine wearing a delicate spritz of it to the gym, if my already expensive little bottle wasn\'t too expensive for that. The only thing that speaks against ordering this fragrance immediately is its really high price.\n\nBut it is an absolutely first-class fragrance. You should have smelled Isola Blu PARFUM at some point.', 'Isola Blu is a typical Roja fragrance with many scents.\nHere too, however, the overall picture is good.\nIt doesn\'t overwhelm, but simply fits together well.\nWith Isola Blu, we naturally get a fragrance that is perfect for spring or summer.\nCitrus-fresh impressions, pleasantly spicy & greenish.\n\nThe fragrance features lime as the main player in the top note.\nA perceived mixture of lime juice and lime zest.\nThere is also some bergamot and lemon.\n\nOver time, a very subtle ""sweetness"" is added. Furthermore, floral notes add a certain depth and fit perfectly into the overall picture.\nThere is also a slightly soapy impression, as well as a greenish vibe and a great matching spiciness.\n\nTowards the end, pleasant woody impressions are added.\n\nMany people always claim to get associations with toilet cleaner and co.\nI can really only begin to understand that.\n\nAll in all, this is a Roja that I really like a lot.\nIn summer it\'s just ""awesome"".', 'Oligarch is a fragrance for a true oligarch, who spends summer vacations on his yacht in the most enchanting locations overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.\nFresh, citrusy, crisp and aromatic.\nAs in all Roja creations, it is difficult to separate the various notes that compose them, but I can say that juniper, citrus and pink pepper are well perceived.\nThe woody structure holds all the volatile components very well, providing truly remarkable longevity for the type of fragrance.\nDespite not being a lover of the genre, I must say that I like it very much: it is fresh, clean, but at the same time has depth.\n\n14 Swarovski cap, engravings and gold plate.\n\nPPS: Oligarch was discontinued due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and was put back on the market under the name of ""Isola Blu""... But the original it\'s only one.', ""The Sospiro Basso is actually very similar to the Roja Isola Blu DNA. I find the Isola Blu a little more citrusy in the opening, while the Basso is greener, almost chewy to my nose. After 30 minutes, they become more and more similar.\nThe H/S of Isola Blu is much better on my skin than that of Basso. I would give the Isola Blu an 8, while I would give the Basso a 6.5. The Basso can only be perceived close to my skin quite quickly.\n\nI also tested Alexandria Nobility for comparison. In my eyes, the fragrance DNA is even better than Isola Blu and Basso. This is probably because I find the Isola Blu DNA, paired with juniper, simply brilliant. At the same time, I wouldn't classify Nobility as unisex as the other two fragrances. To my nose, the fragrance is quite masculine. I would classify the H/S as mediocre. At least on my skin and worse than Isola Blu. I would rate the H/S as 7. Price-performance would be 10."", 'I tend to like smooth, mellow, velvety fresh scents - ones where the sharp, spiky citrus highs get toned down and mellowed out.\n\nIsola Blu is NOT that kind of fragrance.\n\nAs always with Roja fragrances, almost the entirety of the list of 50,000 notes is utterly indistinguishable to my nose. Is there birch in there? Grass? Maté? I mean, I guess so, but it\'s either all so blended together or my nose is so amateurish that I can\'t find 99% of the individual notes.\n\nBut you DO get a sharp, ferocious, cold blast of citrus right upfront. It reads more like citrus peel than citrus juice to me - this is a very dry fragrance to my nose. It isn\'t unpleasant, but it is a little bit unforgiving and unyielding.\n\nI understand why people associate this with Terre d\'Hermes, because the lime and bergamot opening ends up coming across to me very similarly to the grapefruit in TdH.\n\nAfter 15 or so minutes, it does calm down a bit and relaxes into something only slightly more approachable. Once that citrus opening eases up, the rest of the notes get a chance to talk. It\'s green and herbal, and stays bone-dry throughout the wear (which, on me, is about 8 hours). As always, Roja ingredient quality shines: you can ""smell the quality"" here.\n\nThis is an iron fist in a silk glove. I have come to appreciate it quite a bit, and it fills a distinct role in my collection, but I think it\'s a harder fragrance to love than something like Elysium.', ""I have always wanted to test this fragrance, I don't know why but it has always appealed to me\nNow I have bought a 10ml sample and was able to test it for myself\nFirst of all, if you don't like fresh/citrus scents, you're definitely in the wrong place because that's what it's all about\nIsola Blu starts as if you cut open a completely fresh lemon/lime and squeeze it\nThe perfect citrus note that cools you down nicely on hot summer days\nAt first it fades slightly but still remains and there is a light elegant spicy note\nThis fragrance is in my opinion the perfection of a fresh citrus summer fragrance\nFor a summer fragrance, the H/S is also very good (at least better than most)\nIf you are looking for a banger for the summer and like this kind of perfume, I can only recommend Isola Blu, try it and you will be amazed just like everyone else around you when you wear it""]"
